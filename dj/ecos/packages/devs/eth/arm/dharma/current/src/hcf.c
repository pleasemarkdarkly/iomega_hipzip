* ToDo
*
 1:	For all/most functions, update "MSF-accessible fields of Result Block:" entry
 2: Use the "numbered comments" in the NARRATIVE consistently, i.e. hcf_put_info
 3: hcf_put_data, hcf_send, hcf_send_diag_msg
	once the dust is settled whether hcf_put_data or hcf_send is the appropriate place is to specify port,
	it can be considered whether part of the hcf_send_diag_msg and hcf_send can be isolated in a common
	routine.
 4:	hcf_send_diag_msg:
  	- what are the appropriate return values
 5: When optimization seems to become an issue, the numerous hcfio_string() calls in hcf_service_nic
	may be suitable candidates to get some attention 	
 6:	review/walkthough potential problems witrh re-entrancy when HCF_ACT_INT_OFF is called from task level
	and being interrupted

*
* Implementation Notes
*
 -	C++ style cast is not used to keep DA-C happy
 -	a leading marker of //! is used. The purpose of such a sequence is to help the
	(maintenance) programmer to understand the flow
 	An example in hcf_action( HCF_ACT_802_3 ) is
	//!		ifbp->IFB_RxFence = 0;
	which is superfluous because IFB_RxFence gets set at every hcf_service_nic but
	it shows to the (maintenance) programmer it is an intentional omission at
	the place where someone could consider it most appropriate at first glance
 -	using near pointers in a model where ss!=ds is an invitation for disaster, so be aware of how you specify
 	your model and how you define variables which are used at interrupt time
 -	Once the comment "the value of -1 for parameter len is meaningless but it guarantees that the next call
 	to bap_ini is interpreted as an initial call, causing the BAP to be really initialized." was considered
 	useful information. Does this trick still lingers somewhere;?
 -	remember that sign extension on 32 bit platforms may cause problems unless code is carefully constructed,
 	e.g. use "(hcf_16)~foo" rather than "~foo"

	
*
* Miscellaneous Notes
*
 -	AccessPoint performance could be improved by adding a hcf_send_pif_msg equivalent of hcf_send_diag_msg

 Returns:
  o	HCF_ACT_INT_OFF
		0: no interrupt pending
		1: interrupt pending
  o HCF_ACT_DIAG
    always returns HCF_SUCCESS, more info in MailBox
  o HCF_ACT_IN
    reports on the same conditions as hcf_enable, as a consequence of the start of day
    diagnose/selftest strategy
  o HCF_ACT_INT_FORCE_ON, HCF_ACT_INT_ON
    as an aid during debugging, IFB_IntOffCnt is reported
  o HCF_ACT_SCAN, HCF_ACT_TALLIES
    arbitrarily choosen to pass on the return code of cmd_wait, for all purposes as
    currently understood, the return code could just as well  be HCF_SUCCESS
  o	all other
		0 (((however, see the special treatment for HCF_ACT_INT_ON)))

 Remarks:
  o	HCF_ACT_INT_OFF/HCF_ACT_INT_ON codes may be nested but must be balanced. The INT_OFF/INT_ON housekeeping
	is initialized by hcf_connect with a call of hcf_action with INT_OFF, causing the interrupt generation
	mechanism to be disabled at first. This suits MSF implementation based on a polling strategy. An MSFT
	based on a interrupt strategy must call hcf_action with INT_ON in its initialization logic.

  o To prevent I/O while the I/O space is no longer owned by the HCF, due to a card swap, no I/O is allowed
	when the CARD_STAT_PRESENT bit of IFB_CardStat is off.

.DIAGRAM
 0:	<HCFL@
 	This assert checks against re-entrancy. Re-entrancy could be caused by a MSF logic at task-level calling
 	hcf_functions without shielding with HCF_ACT_ON/_OFF. However the HCF_ACT_INT_OFF action itself can
 	per definition not be protected this way. Based on code inspection, it can be conclude, that there is no
 	re-entrancy PROBLEM in this particular flow. Therefore the re-entrancy assert explicitely allows for it.
 	Note that there was a report of an MSF which ran into this assert.
 1:	This assert checks whether the HCF-specific codes have not grown into the area set aside for the DUI.
	This is implemented as runtime code because the preprocessor can not handle code like
	"#if (HCF_ERR_MAX) >= (UIL_ERR_PIF_CONFLICT)
	 error++;
	 #endif"
	with HCF_ERR_MAX and UIL_ERR_PIF_CONFLICT being enumerations.
	The "i = HCF_ERR_MAX" is just a kludge to get around compiler/lint warnings "conditional expression 
	is constant". The desirable statement would be something of the nature:
	HCFASSERT( HCF_ERR_MAX < UIL_ERR_PIF_CONFLICT, HCF_ERR_MAX )									@HCFL>
 2: IFB_IntOffCnt is used to balance the INT_OFF and INT_ON calls.
 4: Disabling of the interrupts is simply achieved by writing a zero to the Hermes IntEn register
 5: To be able to return the information to the MSF whether an interrupt is actually pending, the Hermes
	EvStat register is sampled and compared against the current IFB_IntEnMask value
 6:	Originally the construction "if ( ifbp->IFB_IntOffCnt-- <= 1 )" was used in stead of
 	"if ( --ifbp->IFB_IntOffCnt == 0 )". This serviced to get around the unsigned logic, but as additional
 	"benefit" it seemed the most optimal "fail safe" code (in the sense of shortest/quickest path in error
 	free flows, fail safe in the sense of too many INT_ON invocations compared to INT_OFF). However when a
 	real life MSF programmer ran to a MSF sequence problem, exactly causing that problem, he was annoyed
 	with this fail safe code. As a consequence it is taken out. As a side-effect of this unhappy MSF programmer
 	adventures to find his problem, the return status is defined to reflect the IFBIntOffCnt, Note that this
 	is solely intended for aid debugging, no MSF logic should depend on this feature, No garuantees for the
 	future are given.
 	Enabling of the interrupts is achieved by writing the contents of IFB_IntEnMask to the Hermes IntEn
 	register.
 7:	Since the card is present again, it must be re-initialized. Since this may be another card we may as well
 	clear all bits in IFB_CardStat and set only the "present" bit.
 	<HCFL> Based on IFB_portStat, all the ports which were enabled at card removal time, are re-enabled.
 	The first call to hcf_enable will restore the contents of HREG_INT_EN register taking the
 	HCF_ACT_IN_ON/OFF history in account.
 8:	<HCFL@: The IFB_PortStat bit corresponding with the port that must be re-enabled, must be cleared before
 	calling hcf_enable, because otherwise calling hcf_enable would have no effect. Note that hcf_enable will
 	set that bit again.  																			@HCFL>
 9:	The MSF must call hcf_action with HCF_ACT_CARD_OUT when the MSF detects a card removal (e.g. when the MSF
	is notified by the CAD). As a minimum, the "present" bit in IFB_CardStat must be reset, however since
	the card insertion will clear all other bits, the simplest solution appears to clear all of IFB_CardStat.
	This is O.K. in case of the HCF, but wrong for HCF-light which does not have IFB_PortStat.
	As a result of the resetting of the CARD_STAT_PRESENT bit, no hcf-function except hcf_action with
	HCF_ACT_CARD_IN results in card I/O anymore. However hcf_functions may still perform their other
	activities, e.g. hcf_get_info_mb still supplies a MBIB if one is available.
	As a result of the resetting of the CARD_STAT_INI ((;?990701: out of date))bit, the call to 
	hcf_initialize by hcf_action with HCF_ACT_CARD_IN results in re-initialization of the NIC.
	<HCFL@
10:	No test of IFB_CardStat on CARD_STAT_PRESENT is needed, because this is done by hcf_initialize
11:	after a successful hcf_initialize there is no need to wait for something or other because the cmd_wait in
	hcf_initialize assures that the Hermes is "READY" for the next command. Again note that hcf_initialize protects
	against NIC absence.
	The command is written in line to the Hermes command register rather than using cmd_wait because the
	response time of the Diagnose command is too large. Note that the synchronous Hermes Diagnose command is
	artificially turned into an a-synchronous command at the WCI I/F. The HCF "knows" that a pseude a-synchronous
	command is active based on the low order bits of IFB_CardStat.
12:	tallying of "No inquire space" is done by cmd_wait
	The HCF_ACT_SCAN and HCF_ACT_TALLIES activity are merged by "cleverly" manipulating action so action gets
	the value CFG_SCAN and CFG_TALLIES respectively.
13:	HCF_ACT_TICK_ON/OFF to enable/disable TimerTick interrupt are primarily intended to satisfy the NDIS
	requirement to generate an interrupt on request, a strategy which is believed to serve as a mechanism to
	pull yourselves on your hair out of the swamp.
	It turned out to be convenient as well to debug the ISR in the early stages of creating a driver.
	There is no lower level support routine to remove bits from IFB_IntEnMask, which is resolved in
	HCF_ACT_INT_OFF by clearing this bit explicitly IFB_IntEnMask and let enable_int handle the actual
	update of the Hermes register by adding "zero" to IFB_IntEnMask.
15:	HCF_ACT_802_11/3/3_PURE to set the HCF into either 802.11 frame mode, 802.3 frame mode with encapsulation
	or 802.3 frame mode without encapsulation. This influences where hcf_put_data writes the data into the
	Tx Frame Structure and how hcf_get_data gathers the data from the Rx Frame Structure. It also
	has some impact on the Ethernet-II encapsulation.
//18:	HCF_ACT_ASSERT_OFF/_ON disable or enable respectively the assert mechanism. This feature is not yet
//	crystalized as it seems to compete with the mechanism offered by CFG_REG_MSF_ASSERT
20: do not HCFASSERT( rc, rc ) since rc == HCF_INT_PENDING is no error, all erroneous rc are already
	asserted elsewhere

.DESCRIPTION	Initializes Card and HCF housekeeping

.ARGUMENTS
  void hcf_connect( IFBP ifbp, hcf_io io_base )

.RETURNS
	void

.NARRATIVE

 Parameters:
	ifbp		address of the Interface Block
	io_base		I/O Base address of the NIC


  MSF-accessible fields of Result Block:
	IFB_IOBase				entry parameter io_base
	IFB_IORange				HREG_IO_RANGE (0x40)
	IFB_HCFVersionMajor		the major part of the PVCS maintained version number
	IFB_HCFVersionMinor		the minor part of the PVCS maintained version number
	IFB_Version				version of the IFB layout (0x01 for this release)
	
  Hcf_connect grants access right for the HCF to the IFB and initializes the HCF housekeeping part of the
  IFB. Hcf_connect does not perform any I/O.

  The HCF-Version fields are set dynamically, because I do not know of any C mechanism to have the compiler
  and the version control system (PVCS) cooperate to achieve this at compile time.  The HCFVersions fields are
  constructed by collecting and shifting the low order nibbles of the PVCS controlled ASCII representation.
  Note that the low order nibble of a space (0x20) nicely coincides with the low order nibble of an ASCII '0'
  (0x30). Also note that the code breaks when major or minor number exceeds 99.


.DIAGRAM
 1:	patch_catch is called as early in the flow as the C-entry code allows to help the HCF debugger as much as
	possible.  The philosophy behind patch_catch versus a simple direct usage of the INT_3 macro is explained
	in the description of patch_catch
 2:	The IFB is zero-filled.
 	This presets IFB_CardStat and IFB_TickIni at appropriate values for hcf_initialize.
10: In addition to the MSF readable fields mentioned in the description section, the following HCF specific
	fields are given their actual value:
	  -	a number of fields as side effect of the calls of hcf_action (see item 14)
	  -	IFB_Magic
	IFB_VERSION, which reflects the version of the IFB layout, is defined in HCF.H
12:	JUst to be on the safe side: default IFB_MSFType to 1 in case of an AP. An hermafrodyte is responsible
	to set it "right"
14:	Hcf_connect defaults to "no interrupt generation" (by calling hcf_action with the appropriate parameter),
	"802.3 frame type" and "no card present" (implicitly achieved by the zero-filling of the IFB).
	Depending on HCFL, the 802.3 frame type is either initialized in line or by calling hcf_action.
	
.NOTICE
  If io_base ever needs to be dynamic, it may be more logical to pass
	- io_base at hcf_enable or
	- have a separate hcf_put_config command or
	- demand a hcf_disconnect - hcf_connect sequence
	
.NOTICE
  On platforms where the NULL-pointer is not a bit-pattern of all zeros, the zero-filling of the IFB results
  in an seemingly incorrect initialization of IFB_MBp. The implementation of the MailBox manipulation in
  put_mb_info protects against the absence of a MailBox based on IFB_MBSize, IFB_MBWp and ifbp->IFB_MBRp. This
  has ramifications on the initialization of the MailBox via hcf_put_info with the CFG_REG_MB type.

  //<HCFL@
  It is UNLIKELY that the space allocated for the IFB contains coincidentally  HCF_MAGIC at IFB_Magic, so the
  small chance that HCFASSERT( ifbp->IFB_Magic != HCF_MAGIC ) catches erroneously on an un-initialized memory
  area is considered remote and not to outweigh the benefits of catching calling hcf_connect twice.

  Asserting on re-entrancy of hcf_connect by means of
  "HCFASSERT( (ifbp->IFB_AssertTrace & HCF_ASSERT_CONNECT) == 0, 0 )" is not useful because IFB contents
  are undefined

  Hcf_debug_trigger, which is used to profile the HCF, is not called at entry and exit of hcf_connect because
  hcf_connect has no interaction with the Hermes, so timing is not very interesting. Also constructions like
  "hcf_debug_trigger( ifbp, HCF_ASSERT_CONNECT, ifbp->IFB_IOBase = io_base );" would be needed because the IFB
  is not yet initialized and we want to prevent code pollution in release builds (where the logic to profile
  the HCF should be removed), so the setting of IFB_IOBase must be integrated into the hcf_debug_trigger call.

.NARRATIVE																				<HCFL@
 1:	This assert checks against re-entrancy. Re-entrancy could be caused by a MSF logic at task-level calling
 	hcf_functions without shielding with HCF_ACT_ON/_OFF. When an interrupt occurs, the ISR could (either
 	directly or indirectly) cause re-entering of the interrrupted HCF-routine.
	Note that there is no embargo on calling hcf_diable for a port which is already disabled, hence no
	"HCFASSERT( ifbp->IFB_PortStat & p_bit, port )" should be added to the code.
 2:	determine the bit-flag to represent the specified port in IFB_PortStat.
	Note that as a side effect of this shift no range check on port is needed. Out of range values result
	in a p-bit value which is garuanteed not to be present in IFB_PortStat, hence hcf_disable returns
	immediately
 7: If the requested port is enabled and if the NIC is present, the Hermes Disable command is executed.
	If CARD_STAT_PRESENT is off, part of hcf_disable must be skipped to prevent I/O because the I/O space
	may no longer owned by the HCF, due to a card swap.
10: Even when the NIC is not present, the status bit in IFB_PortStat corresponding with the port parameter
	must be cleared.
12:	When the last port changes from enabled to disabled, the NIC status as reflected by IFB_CardStat must
	change to disabled and the interrupt generation must be disabled.
	Note that since the effect of interrupt disabling has no net effect on IFB_IntOffCnt, this code may
	be called not only at the transition from enabled to disabled but whenever all ports are disabled
40:	Disable the interrupt generation facility without disturbing the MSF controlled IFB_IntOffCnt by
  	decrementing IFB_IntOffCnt to compensate side effect of ACT_INT_OFF action.
  	Note that this is just a fale-safe programming issue. The WCI already requires that the NIC interrupts
  	are disabled when hcf_disable is called.

.NOTICE
 o  hcf_disable may disable the card interrupts, however it does NOT influence IFB_IntOffCnt.
	This way it is symmetrical with hcf_enable, which does NOT enable the card interrupts.

  Parameters:

  Description:
	Brings the NIC in quiescent state by calling ini_hermes, thus preventing any interrupts in the future.

  MSF-accessible fields of Result Block:
  	IFB_CardStat	cleared

.DIAGRAM
 1:	Ini_hermes() is called to bring NIC in quiescent state. Since the MSF is apparently trying to recover
	from a serious problem or going out of business anyway, there is not much point in passing on the return
	status of ini_hermes()
 hcf_initialize gives a justification to execute the Hermes Initialize command only when really needed.
 	Despite this basic philosophy and although the HCF can determine whether the NIC is initialized based
 	on IFB_CardStat, the minimal set of actions to initialize the Hermes is always done by calling
 	ini_hermes.
 5:	clear all IFB fields
 	The clearing of IFB_Magic causes HCFASSERT to catch on all subsequent hcf-functions except hcf_connect.
 	The clearing of IFB_CardStat prevents I/O on any subsequent hcf_function

	hcf_enable takes successively the following actions:

 	To make the WCI fail-safe, invalid port numbers are silently rejected and HCF_ERR_NO_NIC is returned
 	as status.
 	If the MSF+HCF consider themselves incompatible with Primary or Station Supplier in the Hermes, 
 	hcf_enable() does not enable the Hermes. As a side effect of this, other hcf-routines, like hcf_put_data()
 	don't need to check for CARD_STAT_INCOMP_PRI etc, but only for CARD_STAT_ENABLED					@HCFL>
 6:	If the requested port is disabled and if the NIC is present, the Hermes Enable command is executed.
	If CARD_STAT_PRESENT is off, the body of hcf_enable must be skipped to prevent I/O because the I/O space
	may no longer owned by the HCF, due to a card swap.
	The IFB_IntEnMask is set to allow Info events, Receive events and Allocate events to generate interrupts
	and effectuated if appropriate based on IFB_IntOffCnt by calling enable_int.
	Note that this is a dummy action on subsequent enables.												<HCFL>
	Note that since the effect of interrupt enabling has no effect on IFB_IntOffCnt, this code may
	be called not only at the transition from disabled to enabled but whenever a port is enabled.
12:	When the port successfully changes from disabled to enabled - including the case when no NIC is
	present - , the NIC status as reflected by IFB_CardStat must change to enabled
	and the status bit in IFB_PortStat corresponding with the port parameter must be set.				<HCFL>

.APPLICATION	Data Transfer Function for WaveLAN based drivers and utilities
.DESCRIPTION
	Obtains received message data parts from NIC RAM
.ARGUMENTS
  int hcf_get_data( IFBP ifbp, int offset, wci_bufp bufp, int len )
  Card Interrupts disabled
.RETURNS
	HCF_SUCCESS     	O.K
	HCF_ERR_NO_NIC		NIC removed during data copying process
	>>hcfio_string

.NARRATIVE
	parameters:
		ifbp		address of the Interface Block
		offset		offset (in bytes) in buffer in NIC RAM to start copy process
		len			length (in bytes) of data to be copied
		bufp		char pointer, address of buffer in PC RAM

When hcf_service_nic reports the availability of data, hcf_get_data can be called to copy that data
from NIC RAM to PC RAM.

Hcf_get_data copies the number of bytes requested by the parameter len from NIC RAM to PC RAM.  If
len is larger than the (remaining) length of the message, undefined data is appended to the message.
	
Hcf_get_data starts the copy process at the offset requested by the parameter offset, e.g offset
HFS_ADDR_DEST will start copying from the Destination Address, the very begin of the 802.3
framemessage.  At the WCI,the offset specification is geared to "normal" data communication, i.e
depending on IFB_FrameType, Offset == 0 corresponds with the start of the 802.3 MAC header or the
802.11 Header, negative offset correspond with the control structures.  For non-contiguos access of
specific fields, the MSF is shielded of this by meamns of macro definitions.  The HCF transforms the
WCI positive and negative offsets in to the positive-only offsets used at the Host I/F.
	
In case of a fragmented PC RAM buffer, it is the responsibility of the MSF, to specify as offset the
cumulative values of the len parameters of the preceeding hcf_get_data calls.  This I/F gives a MSF
the facility to read (part of) a message and then read it again.
	
Contiguous hcf_get_data calls skip part of the NIC RAM in the follwing cases:
  - IFB_FrameType == 802.11. In this case the 802.3 header is skipped
  - Encapsulated frame. If hcf_service_nic() detected that the frame should be decapsulated, the SNAP
    header is skipped
	
The skip machanism is controlled by IFB_RxFence.  In case of 802.11 this field is set statically by
hcf_action( HCF_ACT_802_11 ).  In case of 802.3 this field is set dynamically by hcf_service_nic().
	
.DIAGRAM

 2: Check on CARD_STAT_PRESENT suffices to suppress all I/O in case card is removed.  A
check on CARD_STAT_ENABLED is not sufficient, because these days CARD_STAT_PRESENT and
CARD_STAT_ENABLED are independent.  Note that in the original design the NIC could not be enabled
unless present.  An alternative would be to check for an exact match on CARD_STAT_PRESENT and
CARD_STAT_ENABLED like:
	if ( ( ifbp->IFB_CardStat & (CARD_STAT_PRESENT|CARD_STAT_ENABLED) ) ==
		 (CARD_STAT_PRESENT|CARD_STAT_ENABLED) )
		
 4: seperate negative offsets (to access control structure information) from positive offsets (to
	access data)
 6: determine the 802.3/11 dependent absolute offset to add to the (relative) positive offset
	specified by the MSF
	Note that from here on offset is positive, so it can be cast to hcf_16 in the call of
	hcfio_string without problems

8: check whether a part of the data must be skipped.  In case of 802.11 the 802.3 MAC header must be
skipped (IFB_RxFence set by hcf_cation).  In case of encapsualted Ethernet-II, the SNAP header must
be skipped (IFB_RxFEnce set by hcf_service_nic).

10:	gather the part before the area to be skipped

12: set the absolute index in the NIC RAM frame structure just behond the data which must be
skipped.  Note that if in point 8 not sufficient data is read to reach this point, len == 0, so the
read in the next point does not have any effect

14: gather the data/information in case of:
	- control structure access (negative offset)
	- no data to be skipped (plain 802.3)
	- data after the area to be skipped (802.11 after reading the 802.11 header, E-II after
	  reading the MAC header).  In both of these cases, len may have become zero (hence no "real"
	  read) depending on the value of the parameters offset and len

16: hcf_get_data passes the hcfio_string return status on to its caller.  See hcfio_string for more
details.  may be either HCF_ERR_TIME_OUT, ref

.NOTICE
IFB_FSBase is used at so many places, that the strategy to turn it into a (redundant) entity
by its own is considered advantaguous compared with determining its value at evry place where it is
needed.
	
It could be considered to ACK the Hermes Rx Event as soon as the MSF has read the last byte to
optimize the flow ( a better chance to get new Rx data in the next pass through hcf_service_nic ).
In that case IFB_RxFID and IFB_RxLen should be set to 0 and it may be advisable to test on
IFBR_RxLen ratjer than IFB_RxFID in hcf_service_nic.

    Note the HCF_ERR_LEN is NOT adequately set, when L >= 2 but less than needed


 Remarks: Transfers operation information and transient and persistent
 	configuration information from the Card and from the HCF to the MSF.
	The exact layout of the provided data structure
	depends on the action code. Copying stops if either the complete
	Configuration Information is copied or if the number of bytes indicated
	by len is copied.  Len acts as a safe guard against Configuration
	Information blocks which have different sizes for different Hermes
	versions, e.g. when later versions support more tallies than earlier
	versions. It is a consious decision that unused parts of the PC RAM buffer are not cleared.

 Remarks: The only error against which is protected is the "Read error"
	as result of Card removal. Only the last hcf_io_string need
	to be protected because if the first fails the second will fail
	as well. Checking for cmd_wait errors is supposed superfluous because
	problems in cmd_wait are already caught or will be caught by
	hcf_enable.
	
	CFG_MB_INFO: copy the oldest MailBox Info Block or the "null" block if none available. <HCFL>
	
 3:	tallying of "No inquire space" is done by cmd_wait

 Note:
	the codes for type are "cleverly" chosen to be identical to the RID
	
	//<HCFL@
    The mechanism to HCF_ASSERT on invalid typ-codes in the LTV record is based on the following strategy:
	  - during the pseudo-asynchronous Hermes commands (diagnose, download)	only CFG_MB_INFO is acceptable
	  -	some codes (e.g. CFG_TALLIES) are explicitly handled by the HCF which implies that these codes
		are valid
	  - all other codes in the range 0xFC00 through 0xFFFF are passed to the Hermes.  The Hermes returns an
	  	LTV record with a zero value in the L-field for all Typ-codes it does not recognize. This is
	  	defined and intended behavior, so HCF_ASSERT does not catch on this phenomena.
	  -	all remaining codes are invalid and cause an ASSERT.
    //@HCFL>

12:	see NOTICE	
17:	The return status of cmd_wait and the first hcfio_in_string can be ignored, because when one fails, the
 	other fails via the IFB_DefunctStat mechanism
20:	"HCFASSERT( rc == HCF_SUCCESS, rc )" is not suitable because this will always trigger as side effect of
	the HCFASSERT in hcf_put_info which calls hcf_get_info to figure out whether the RID exists at all.
	
	
.NOTICE	The protection in hcf_get_info() is less restrictive than the protection in hcf_put_info(). This is
	one of those cases that are impossible to decide at forehand what is the beststrategy. The current
	choice implies that an Information RID (e.g. MaxTransmitLifetime, 0xFD4a) can not be changed into
	a Configuration RID in a transparent fashion for the HCF

.NARRATIVE

  Parameters:
	ifbp		address of the Interface Block
	cntl		INI_PARTIAL, minimal initilization as needed for download and before diagnose
				INI_COMPLETE, complete initialization
				
  Condition Settings:
	Card Interrupts: Disabled as side effect of ini_hermes() (Note that the value of IFB_IntOffCnt is unchanged)

  In fact hcf_initialize is an hcf-support routine, given an hcf_... name just in case we want to
  export it over the WCI later
  
  hcf_initialize will successively:
  -	initialize the NIC by calling ini_hermes
  -	calibrate the S/W protection timer against the Hermes Timer by calling calibrate
  - check HSI/Primary compatibility with the HCF
  - collect the parameters to be used in the non-volatile download process
  - check Station compatibility with the HCF
  - pre-allocate 3 buffers in NIC RAM
  - re-configure the Hermes based on IFB_CfgTbl


.NARRATIVE
 2:	Clear all fields of the IFB except those which need to survive hcf_initialize. This is intended to make
 	the behavior and - as a consequence - the debugging of the HCF more reproduceable.
	Especially IFB_DefunctStat must be cleared (new round, new chances)
 4: If the card is not present, return to the caller with appropriate error status. 
 6:	Initialize the Hermes (to the extend possible via the Host I/F) by calling ini_hermes(). The interrupt 
 	generation facility is disabled as side effect of ini_hermes(). If this initialization fails, return 
 	to the caller with appropriate error status.
 	Note that ini_hermes checks for Card Presence, so hcf_initialize does not need to do this.
 8: drop all error status bits in IFB_CardStat since they are expected to be re-evaluated.
10:	Calibrate the S/W time-out protection mechanism by calling calibrate().If this calibration fails, return 
 	to the caller with appropriate error status. 
14:	check_comp() is called to check the Supplier Range of the Host-S/W I/F (HSI) and the Primary Firmware 
	and checked against the Top and Bottom level supported by this HCF.
	If either of these tests fails, the CARD_STAT_INCOMP_PRI bit of IFB_CardStat is set and control returns
 	to the caller with appropriate error status. 
28: <HCFL@ The available CONCATENATED storage starting at IFB_DLTarget is used to create an LTV-record
	to retrieve the non-volatile download characteristics Download buffer location (IFB_DLPage, IFB_DLOffset)
	and size IFB_DLLen. This information is used in the non-volatile RAM download.
	In case of a Primary Incompatibility, the IFB_DLTarget LTV is not retrieved, causing IFB_DLLen to stay
	zero, implicitly making NV-RAM download impossible.
	Incompatible Station firmware - as opposed to Incompatible Primary Firmware - does not preclude NV-RAM
	download to allow upgrade of NIC with broken or incompatible station firmware. For this reason, the
	Statin F/W Compatibility test must follow download info retrieval. If this retrieval fails, return 
 	to the caller with appropriate error status.													@HCFL>
30: The necessary initialization of the NIC as well as the necessary information gathering for download
	is now done, so skip all station and configuration stuff if we are preparing for download
32: In case of a HCF compiled for station functionality, the Supplier Range of the Station Firmware function
	is retrieved from the Hermes and checked against the Top and Bottom level supported by this HCF.
	Note that the Firmware can have multiple Variants, but that the HCF currently only supports a single
	variant.
34:	pre-allocate 3 buffers in NIC RAM
	 - Tx Frame Structure for the protocol stack
	 - Tx Frame Structure for the utility (;? could be restricted to STA)
	   Note that this subsequent allocate is only performed if the preceding one succeeded
	   If both allocates succeeded, the corresponding Resource Indicators are set
 		The "ASSERT( ifbp->IFB_PIFLoadIdx = 0xFFFF )" does never catches, but initializes IFB_PIFLoadIdx 
 		to be tested by an ASSERT in hcf_put_data if and only the ASSERT mechanism is enabled.
	 - Information Frame Structure for the Notify command (AP only)
	   If the allocate succeeded, the corresponding Resource Indicators is set
	   After two successive allocates, it is assumed that the third is "garuanteed" to succeed, so no bother 
	   to pass the return status on to the caller. Note that even if the third allocate() fails, no 
	   catastrophes will occur because IFB_NotifyRscInd stays zero.
40:	re-configure the Hermes based on IFB_CfgTbl
	
.NOTICE
 o  hcf_initialize disables the card interrupts as side effect of ini_hermes(), however it does NOT influence 
 	IFB_IntOffCnt. This way it is symmetrical with hcf_enable, which does NOT enable the card interrupts.

  void

.DESCRIPTION	Transfers (part of) transmit message to the NIC and handles
	the Ethernet-II encapsulation if applicable
.NARRATIVE
	parameters:
		ifbp		address of the Interface Block
		bufp		char pointer, address of buffer in PC RAM
		len			length (in bytes) of data to be copied
		port		HCF_PORT_0 - HCF_PORT_6 .........;?
					HCF_PUT_DATA_RESET


	Refer to hcf_service;?non-existing reference, for a concise description about possible
	relation/sequencing of hcf_put_data in the Interrupt Service Routine

	Hcf_put_data() does not need a return value to report unexpected NIC removal, because the MSF and higher 
	layers must be able to cope anyway with the NIC being removed after a successful completion of 
	hcf_put_data() + hcf_send() but before the actual transmission took place. If hcfio_string() fails, 
	this will result in a failing hcf_send, so it will be reported to the MSF with some delay.
	
	In essence, hcf_put_data copies the number of bytes specified by parameter len from the location in PC
	RAM specified by bufp to the NIC RAM buffer associated with the Protocol Stack dedicated FID.
	The first call succeeding hcf_send (or hcf_enable), writes the first byte at offset HFS_ADDR_DEST in
	the transmit data buffer, successive hcf_put_data calls continue where the preceeding hcf_put_data stopped.
	
	IFB_FrameType determines whether the message in the PC RAM buffer is interpreted as an 802.3 or 802.11
	frame.  This influences:
 	o the position where the first byte of the initial hcf_put_data is stored
 	o Only in case of the 802.3 frame type, hcf_put_data checks whether the frame is an Ethernet-II rather
 	  than an "official" 802.3 frame. The E-II check is based on the length/type field in the MAC header. If
 	  this field has a value larger than 1500, E-II is assumed. The implementation of this test fails if the
	  length/type field is split over 2 hcf_put_data calls.
	  If E-II is recognized, the length field HFS_LEN_ABS is skipped for the time being and a SNAP header is
	  inserted starting at HFS_DAT_ABS. This SNAP header represents either RFC1042 or Bridge-Tunnel
	  encapsulation, depending on whether the type is absent or present in enc_trans_tbl.
 	o In case of the 802.11 frame type, hcf_put_data checks whether the complete header + length field is
 	  written (note that part of the header may be written by previous hcf_put_data calls and part may be
 	  written by this call).  If so, the next byte is written at HFS_DAT_ABS (the 802.3 header area is skipped)

	It is allowed to write the 802.3 header, 802.11 header and/or data in fragments, e.g. the first
	hcf_put_data call writes 18 bytes starting at location HFS_ADDR_1_ABS and the second call writes 6 more
	bytes starting at location HFS_ADDR_4. Although Address part #4 is not present in some 802.11 headers,
	all 4 addressing parts and the length field must be written in case of 802.11. Once the complete header
	is written, the data part is written starting from offset HFS_DAT_ABS.

	Hcf_put_data does not check for transmit buffer overflow because the Hermes does this protection.
	In case of a transmit buffer overflow, the surplus which does not fit in the buffer is simply dropped.
	Note that this possibly results in the transmission of incomplete frames.

.DIAGRAM
1*: If the card is not present, prevent all I/O because "our" I/O base may have been given away to someone
	else in a CS/SS environment.  Also no I/O should be performed if the NIC is not enabled. However
	an MSF which calls hcf_put_data while the NIC is not enabled probably contains a logic flaw (or has a
	strategy which was not foreseen at the time this was written)
10* HCF_PUT_DATA_RESET discards all the data put by preceeding hcf_put_data calls and resets the HCF
	housekeeping just the same as after an hcf_send triggered allocate event.
	Note: To make the WCI fail-safe, invalid port numbers are silently rejected by treating them as
	HCF_PUT_DATA_RESET. Note that the assumption is that this should never ever occure in a debugged MSF and
	that during debugging the ASSERT is sufficient support to help the MSF programmer.
2*:	This statement is only true at the first hcf_put_data call after an hcf_send result or hcf_enable
	The housekeeping is done.
 	o the PIFRscInd is cleared, so the MSF can not begin another hcf_put_data/hcf_send sequence
	before completing the current one
 	o the Tx Encoding flag (TxFrameType) is cleared
 	o the index to the first free position in the FID (IFB_PIFLoadIdx) is initialized based on IFB_FSBase.
 	  IFB_FSBase is initialized when hcf_action is called with HCF_ACT_802_3 or HCF_ACT_802_11
3*:	Pay Attention: it may seem attractive to change this code, e.g. to save the superfluous call to
	hcfio_out_string when the Destination and Source address are written by the preceeding call and the
	current call starts at the length/type field. However this code is "reasonably carefully" crafted
	to take in account all boundary conditions. It is very easy to make a change which does not work under
	all feasible split ups of the message in fragments.
	First IFB_PIFLoadIdx is checked.
	  - If IFB_PIFLoadIdx points past HFS_LEN_ABS, the preceeding call(s) to hcf_put_data already passed the
	  length/type field. As a consequence the fragment can be concatenated to the data already copied to
	  NIC RAM.
	  - If IFB_PIFLoadIdx does not point past HFS_LEN_ABS, the current fragment may or may not contain part of
	  the Destination and/or Source Address and it may or may not contain the length/type field.
	  If the fragment contains addressing information or -in case of 802.11- length info , this information
	  is copied/concatenated to the NIC RAM buffer. The working variables (pointer and length of fragment) as
	  well as the IFB_PIFLoadIdx are adjusted.
	The semi-obscure differences in the boundary testing are caused by:
	  o 802.11: the "below the boundary" area is Addr1, Addr2, Addr3, Ctrl, Adrr4 + DataLen and the "above"
	  	area is the "real" data
	  o 802.3: the "below the boundary" area is DestAddr + SrcAddr and the "above" area is the length +
	  	"real" data
	  o E-II: the "below the boundary" area is DestAddr + SrcAddr, then there is a "virtual" area with the
	  	SNAP header (which will in the end include the HCF calculated length)  and the "above" area is the
	  	"protocol stack length" (is in reality the type code) + "real" data
4*:	If there is still data left, IFB_PIFLoadIdx may need adjustment (802.11 and E-II encapsulation).  Again
	note that this length check is crucial to prevent mis-manipulation of IFB_PIFLoadIdx in case the header
	is written in multiple fragments.
	In case of 802.3, the E-II check is done. In case of E-II, the encapsulation type (RFC1042 versus
	Bridge-Tunnel) is determined and the corresponding SNAP header is written to NIC RAM and
	IFB_PIFLoadIdx is adjusted.
6*:	All data which is not already copied under 3*, is copied here.
	In case of 802.11, the HFS_DAT field is the first field written by this code.
	In case of 802.3, the HFS_LEN field is the first field written by this code.
	In case of E-II encapsulation, the HFS_TYPE field is the first field written by this code.
	Note that in case of E-II encapsulation, the HFS_LEN field is not written by hcf_put_data at all, but by
	hcf_send because the data length is not	known till all fragments have been processed.
	
.NOTE	
	The possible split of a single hcf_put_data call into 2 calls to hcfio_out_string results in 2 calls
	to bap_ini, which may be unexpected while you are debugging, but is never the less the intended behavior.
	Along the same line a call of hcfio_out_string with a value of 0 for parameter len may be unexpected, e.g.
	when the len parameter of hcf_put_data is either 1 or 2, the latter depending on the odd/even aspects of
	IFB_PIFLoadIdx.	
	
	The HCFASSERT on the combination of IFB_PIFLoadIdx and IFB_PIFRscInd is prepared by the (never catching)

.NOTE
	The test on PIFRscInd to distinguish the initial hcf_put_data from subsequent calls is not thread safe.
	It is assumed that threaded MSFs have their own mechanism to assure that hcf_put_data calls belonging to

		ifbp		address of the Interface Block
		offset		offset (in bytes) in relative to Destination Address field of Tx FRame
		bufp		char pointer, address of buffer in PC RAM
		len			length (in bytes) of data to be copied
		check		value which should be contained in the byte immediately after the header
		
		
		
		which is garuanteed not to be present in the original dummy header
					HCF_PUT_DATA_RESET
	
	Hcf_put_header copies the number of bytes specified by parameter len from the location in PC
	RAM specified by bufp to the position specified by offset + HFS_ADDR_DEST_ABS in the NIC RAM buffer 
	associated with the Protocol Stack dedicated FID.
	Hcf_put_header must be called after the last hcf_put_data needed to write the actual frame to the transmit
	data buffer and preceeding the hcf_send call. Only a single hcf_put_header call is allowed.
	Hcf_put_header overwrites the data which was written at the corresponding locations by hcf_put_data.
	
	First hcf_put_header checks whether the preceding hcf_put_data call(s) suffered a Data Corruption. If so,
	hcf_put_header returns without writing the header with a return value of ;?HCF_FAILURE.
	Next hcf_put_header copies an even number of bytes (specified by datlen) from Host RAM (specified by
	bufp ) to the Transmit Frame Structure at the even offset (specified by offset) relative to HFS_ADDR_DEST_ABS

	
.DIAGRAM
1*: If the card is not present or not enabled, prevent all I/O. This is especially important in case the card
	is not present, because in that case "our" I/O base may have been given away to someone
	else in a CS/SS environment.  Also no I/O should be performed if the NIC is not enabled. However
	an MSF which calls hcf_put_data while the NIC is not enabled probably contains a logic flaw (or has a
	strategy which was not foreseen at the time this was written)
2*:	Perform the DataCorruptionWorkAround check
4*:	write the header over the garbage header which was written by the preceeding hcf_put_data() calls.
	Note that the original garbage header should NOT contain check, the first byte of the data after the 
	header written by hcf_put_header(). Return status is ignored, since the preceeding hcf_iostring did
	not fail and a failing hcf_iostring should also result in failing hcf_send
6*:	Perform a (minimized) DataCorruptionWorkAround check by reading back the first byte after the garbage
	header as written by the preceeding hcf_put_data() calls. Since the HCF has no knowledge what that byte
	should be, it is the responsibilty of the MSF to supply this value.
	If the test fails, retry up to two times.
	Note that hcfio_string can not be used for the DCWA check because that would corrupt the data after the
	header
8*:	Mimick the hcfio_string behavior

.NARRATIVE
	parameters:
		ifbp		address of the Interface Block
		ltvp		specifies the RID (as defined by Hermes I/F) or pseudo-RID (as defined by WCI)

.NOTICE
 Remarks:
	The Hermes puts additional sequence constraints on the usage of hcf_put_info,
	e.g. CFG_NOTIFY is only allowed after hcf_enable

 Remarks:  In case of Hermes Configuration LTVs, the codes for the type are "cleverly" chosen to
	be identical to the RID. Hermes Configuration information is copied from the provided data 
	structure into the Card.
	In case of HCF Configuration LTVs, the type values are choosen in a range which does not overlap
	the RID-range.
	
	//<HCFL@
 Remarks:  In order to make the changes sustain over activities like hcf_diagnose and recovery from PCMCIA 
 	card insertion, Hermes Configuration LTVs are saved in the IF-block.

    The mechanism to HCF_ASSERT on invalid typ-codes in the LTV record is based on the following strategy:
	  -	some codes (e.g. CFG_REG_MB) are explicitly handled by the HCF which implies that these codes
		are valid
	  - all other codes are passed to the Hermes.  Before the put action is executed, hcf_get_info is called
	  	with an LTV record with a value of 1 in	the L-field and the intended put action type in the Typ-code
	  	field. If the put action type is valid, it must definitely be valid as a get action type code, so
	  	the HCF_ASSERT logic of hcf_get_info should not catch.
    //@HCFL>	
	
.DIAGRAM
02:	see NOTICE in hcf_get_info()
    //<HCFL@
19:	if HCF_ASSERT is not defined, the else clause absorbs the "return rc;" statement. This is plainly not the
	intention, hence the semi-colon after the first HCFASSERT, so there will be at least an empty statement
	after the else.
	Note that I consider it an error of those compilers who do not flag this problem, e.g. MSVC 4 as used
	for the Miniport (jumps over the mov ax, [bp-n] without complaining about "no return value"), MSVC 1.5 as
	used for the DOS ODI (inserts a NOP and has all if/if_else branches jump to the mov ax, [bp-6], which is
	what I wanted but not what I asked for), Borland 3.1 as used for WavePoint (which even gets confused to
	the level where it leaves out necessary instructions in the if_else branches, skips the mov ax, [bp-n]
	without complaints)
	//@HCFL>

.NOTICE
	Future enhancements in the functionality offered by the WCI and/or implementation aspects of the HCF
	may warrant filtering on the type-field of the LTV to recognize non-MSF accessible records, e.g. CFG_TICK

.RETURNS

.NARRATIVE

 Parameters:
  ifbp	address of the Interface Block
  type

	Hcf_send transmits the Protocol Stack message loaded in NIC RAM by the
	preceeding hcf_put_data calls.
	
	Hcf_send() does not NEED a return value to report NIC absence or removal during the execution of hcf_send(),
	because the MSF and higher layers must be able to cope anyway with the NIC being removed after a successful 
	completion of hcf_put_data() + hcf_send() but before the actual transmission took place. To accomodate
	user expectations the current implementation does report NIC absence.

.DIAGRAM
1:	The actual data length (the number of bytes in the Tx Frame structure
	following the 802.3/802.11 Header Info blocks, is determined by
	IFB_PIFLoadIdx, the index in the Transmit Frame Structure to store the
	"next" byte. Note that this value must be compensated for the header info
	by subtracting HFS_DAT.
2/3:TxFrameType - which is based on the preceding hcf_put_data calls - defines
	whether the actual data length is written to the 802.11 or 802.3 Header Info
	block.
2:	In case of 802.11, the entry parameter type is augmented to reflect	802.11
	before it is written to the Control Field block.
3:	In case of 802.3, the actual length must be converted from the native
	format of the Host (Little Endian in case of an 80x86) to Big Endian before
	it is written to the 802.3 Header Info block.
4:	The actual send+reclaim command is performed by the routine send.
7:	The return status of hcfio_in_string can be ignored, because when it fails, cmd_wait will fail via the
 	IFB_DefunctStat mechanism
17:	The return status of cmd_wait and the first hcfio_in_string can be ignored, because when one fails, the
 	other fails via the IFB_DefunctStat mechanism
19:	The "HCFASSERT( ifbp->IFB_PIFLoadIdx = 0xFFFF )" does never catches, but initializes IFB_PIFLoadIdx to
    be tested by an HCFASSERT in hcf_put_data if and only the ASSERT mechanism is enabled
.NOTICE
  ;?This comment is definitely out of date
  The choice to let hcf_send calculate the actual data length as
  IFB_PIFLoadIdx - HFS_DAT, implies that hcf_put_data with the HFS_LUCENT
  mechanism MUST be used to write the Data Info Block. A change in this I/F
  will impact hcf_send as well.
  An alternative would be to have a parameter datlen. If datlen is zero, the
  current behavior is used. If datlen has a non-zero value, its value is used
  as the actual data length (without validating against HCF_MAX_MSG and without
  validating the total number of bytes put by hcf_put_data).

.NOTICE
  hcf_put_data/send leave the responsibility to only send messages on enabled ports at the MSF level.
  This is considered the strategy which is sufficiently adequate for all "robust" MSFs, have the least
  processor utilization and being still acceptable robust at the WCI !!!!!

 Parameters:

	hcf_service_nic is primarily intended to be part of the Interrupt Service Routine.
	hcf_service_nic is presumed to neither interrupt other HCF-tasks nor to be interrupted by other HCF-tasks.
	A way to achieve this is to precede hcf_service_nic as well as all other HCF-tasks with a call to
	hcf_action to disable the card interrupts and, after all work is completed, with a call to hcf_action to
	restore (which is not necessarily the same as enabling) the card interrupts.
	In case of a polled environment, it is assumed that the MSF programmer is sufficiently familiar with the
	specific requirements of that environment to translate the interrupt strategy to a polled strategy.
	
	hcf_service_nic services the following Hermes events:
		HREG_EV_INFO		Asynchronous Information Frame
		HREG_EV_INFO_DROP	WMAC did not have sufficient RAM to build Unsolicited Information Frame
		HREG_EV_ALLOC		Asynchronous part of Allocation/Reclaim completed
		HREG_EV_RX			the detection of the availability of received messages
                            including WaveLAN Management Protocol (WMP) message processing  //<HCFL>

	//<HCFL@
    A received message can be either "NOS" messages or "WMP" (aka DUIF) messages.
	A WMP message is recognized by the Hermes and reported as such in the Status field of the Rx Frame
	Structure. A number of WMP messages are handled by the Hermes and are never passed to the Host at all.
	The error free WMP messages which are passed to the Host are stored in the MailBox (assuming one with
	sufficient free space is available). As a side effect, when IFB_MBInfoLen is zero, it is updated to
	reflect the size of the MailBox Information Block used to store the WMP message.
	;? If Monitor Mode is active, a WMP message SHOULD be considered a NOS message. Current implementation
	moves all ERRORFREE messages (also those addressed to other stations) into the MailBox. Frames
	containing errors are passed to the MSF as is (without decapsulation). Note that the
	Hermes does NOT pass those WMP frames to the host to which the Hermes generated a response.

	An available NOS messages is a message which:
	 -	is received by the LAN Controller with an OK status and which is not an WMP message
	 -	All messages (;?including WMP messages and messages with an error status) when Monitor Mode is enabled
    //@HCFL>
	If a message is available, its length is reflected by the IFB_RxLen field of the IFB. This length
	reflects the data itself and the Destination Address, Source Address and DataLength/Type field but not the
	SNAP-header in case of decapsulation by the HCF).
	If no message is available, IFB_RxLen is zero.

  **Rx Buffer free strategy
	When hcf_service_nic reports the availability of a message, the MSF can access that message or parts
	thereof, by means of hcf_get_data calls till the next call of hcf_service_nic. Therefore it must be
	prevented that the LAN Controller writes new data in the buffer associated with the last hcf_service_nic
	report.
	As a consequence hcf_service_nic is the only procedure which can free receive buffers for re-use by the
	LAN Controller. Freeing a buffer is done implicitly by acknowledging the Rx event to the Hermes. The
	strategy of hcf_service_nic is to free the buffer it has reported as containing an available message in
	the preceeding call (assuming there was an available message).
	A consequence of this strategy is that the Interrupt Service Routine of the MSF must repeatedly call
	hcf_service_nic till hcf_service_nic returns "no message available". It can be reasoned that
	hcf_action( INT_ON ) should not be given before the MSF has completely processed a reported Rx-frame. The
	reason is that the INT_ON action is guaranteed to cause a (Rx-)interrupt (the MSF is processing a
	Rx-frame, hence the Rx-event bit in the Hermes register must be active). This interrupt will cause
	hcf_service_nic to be called, which will cause the ack-ing of the "last" Rx-event to the Hermes,
	causing the Hermes to discard the associated NIC RAM buffer.


.DIAGRAM
 2: IFB_RxLen and IFB_RxStat must be cleared before the NIC presence check otherwise these values may stay
 	non-zero if the NIC is pulled out at an inconvenient moment
 4: If the card is not present, prevent all I/O because "our" I/O base may have been given away to someone
	else in a CS/SS environment.
	The MSF may have considerable latency in informing the HCF of the card removal by means of hcf_action().
	To prevent that hcf_service_nic reports bogus information to the MSF with all - possibly difficult to
	debug - undesirable side effects, hcf_service_nic pays performance wise the prize to use the momentanuous
	NIC presence test by checking the contents of the Hermes register HREG_SW_0 against the value HCF_MAGIC.
 6:	The return status of hcf_service_nic is defined as reflecting all interrupt causes this call has run into,
 	hence an accumulator is needed. This return status services ONLY to help the MSF programmer to debug the
 	total system.
 	When the card is removed, the pseudo event HREG_EV_NO_CARD is reported.
 	NOTE, the HREG_EV_NO_CARD bit is explicitly not intended for the MSF to detect NIC removal. The MSF must
 	use its own - environment specific - means for that.
    //<HCFL@
    The reception of a WMP message is reported by means of the pseudo-event HREG_EV_DUIF_RX
    This bit is set in addition to the HREG_EV_RX bit.
 8:	hcf_service_nic loops to handle frame reception which is handled at the HCF level without being reported
	to the MSF. This are currently only the WMP frames which are stored in the MailBox.
    //@HCFL>
10:	ack the "old" Rx-event. See "Rx Buffer free strategy" above for more explanation.
    IFB_RxFID, IFB_RxLen and IFB_RxStat must be cleared to bring both the internal HCF house keeping as the
    information supplied to the MSF in the state "no frame received"
12:	The event status register of the Hermes is sampled and all non-Rx activities are handled.
 	The non-Rx activities are:
	 -	Info drop events are handled by incrementing a tally
	 -	LinkEvent (including solicited and unsolicited tallies) are handled by procedure isr_info.
	 -	Alloc, handled by setting the resource indicator.
		<HCFL@  The corresponding FID register is sampled, and based on this FID, either
		the IFB_PIFRscInd, the IFB_DUIFRscInd or the IFB_NotifyRscInd is raised.
	 	Note that no ASSERT is performed to check whether the RscInd corresponding with the sampled
	 	HREG_ALLOC_FID has a zero value. It is felt that this obscures the code to the reader while adding
	 	little practical value
		Note: during the exceution of alloc(), Card Interrupts are disabled as a side effect of 
		hcf_initialiaze(). This prevents that the ISR can get control while IFB_PIF_FID and IFB_DUIF_FID are
		not yet defined.																			@HCFL>
13:	Asserting on RscInd == 0 does not seem worth the effort	 	
14:	All the non-Rx/non-Cmd activities are acknowledged. Combining all these acknowledgements to a single
	place, is considered an optimization.
	Note that the Rx-acknowledgement is explicitly not included, as justified in "Rx Buffer free strategy" above.
	Note that the Cmd-acknowledgement is explicitly not included, because all command handling is handled
	in line.
	<HCFL@  Refer to get_info_mb for more details on  acknowledgement of the pseudo-asynchronous commands
	(diagnose and download non-volatile ).															@HCFL>
16:	The handling of the non-Rx activities, may have bought the Hermes sufficient time to raise an Rx event
	in the event status register (assuming an other Rx event was pending and this loop through hcf_service_nic
	acknowledged an Rx event). Therefore the event status register is sampled again. If a frame is available,
	the FID of that frame and the characteristics (status and length) are read from the NIC. These values are,
	after Endianess conversion if needed, stored in IFB_RxStat and IFB_RxLen. IFB_RxLen is also adjusted for
	the size of the 802.3 MAC header. ;? Note: Whether this adjustment is the correct/most optimal for 802.11
	is debatable, however it is paramount that IFB_RxFID and IFB_RxLEN must either be both zero or both
	non-zero to get a coherent behavior of the MSF+HCF.
18:	If the Hermes frame status reflects an error - which can only occure in promiscuous mode - the frame
	is not further processed and control is passed back to the MSF
20:	<HCFL@  WMP messages are processed by copying them to the MailBox. Accu is updated to reflect the reception
	of the WMP frame to the debugger and sample is modified to go once more through the loop in the hope
	to process the next pending Rx frame.
	Note that in case of promiscuous mode, the HFS_CNTL_STAT_WMP_MSG is never set.  				@HCFL>
22: Both in 802.11 mode and 802.3_pure mode, the frame is not further processed (no decapsulation) and
	control is passed back to the MSF.
	In 802.3 mode the HCF checks whether decapsulation is needed (i.e. the Hermes reported Tunnel
	encapsulation or the Hermes reported 1042 Encapsulation and the frame type does not match one of the
	values in enc_trans_tbl.
	The IFB_RxFence field, which plays a role in the decapsulation process, is initialized.
	The actual decapsulation takes place on the fly in hcf_get_data, based on the value of IFB_RxFence.
	Note that in case of decapsulation the SNAP header is not passed to the MSF, hence IFB_RxLen must be
	compensated for the SNAP header length
24:	If a WMP frame is received, another loop through hcf_service_nic is made, acknowledging     //<HCFL>
	this WMP frame as a side effect.                                                            //<HCFL>
	
	
	
xx: Decapsulation is NOT done in case of:
	- WMP messages transferred to the MailBox
	- IFB_FrameType == HCF_ACT_802_3_PURE or HCF_ACT_802_11
	- in case of eronuoes frame in promiscuous mode
	Decapsulation is done in case of error free frame in promiscuous mode
	
.NOTICES
    To make it possible to discriminate between a message without payload (only MAC addresses and implicit
    the length) it is a convenient I/F to add 14 ( space occupied by MAC addresses and Length) to the
    Hermes reported payload. So the maintenance programmer should be forwarned when considering changing
    this strategy. Also the impact on 802.11 should be considered ;?
	
	Possibly the two consecutive hcf_io_string() calls to gather IFB_RxLen and IFB_RxStat could be
	optimized by using a read/discard/read sequence. Superficially measurements of BAP setup times
	suggest that this optimization is hardly worthwhile (if at all)

 Parameters:
  ifbp	address of the Interface Block

  ASSERTS:                                                                                  //<HCFL@

.DIAGRAM
 1:	execute the allocate command by calling cmd_wait
 2: wait till either the alloc event or a time-out occures
 3: if the alloc event occures,
 	- read the FID to return it to the caller of alloc
 	- acknowledge the alloc event
 	- clear the storage allocated in NIC RAM (see notice below)
 4: The return status of alloc is used to carry the fid-value. This, together with the observation that
	already multiple successful interactions (e.g. hcf_get_info() ) with the Hermes took place before 
	alloc() is called, warrant the ignoring of the return status of hcfio_string.
 8:	since alloc is only called after an Hermes initialize command but before the Hermes enable, a failing
	allocation is considered a H/W failure, hence the Miscellaneous Error tally is incremented
	
.NOTICE
 o  Clearing the FID is not only an aesthetical matter, it is also the cheapest (code-size) way to enforce
 	  -	correlation between IFB_TxCntl (which is cleared by hcf_disable) and the field HFS_TX_CNTL_ABS of a
 		IFB_PIF_FID
 	  -	zero value of the field HFS_TX_CNTL_ABS of a IFB_DUIF_FID (hcf_send_diag_msg only supports port 0)

.MODULE			calibrate
.LIBRARY 		HCF_SUP
.TYPE 			function
.SYSTEM			msdos
.SYSTEM			unix
.SYSTEM			NW4
.APPLICATION	Support for HCFR routines
.DESCRIPTION	calibrates the S/W protection counter against the Hermes Timer tick

.ARGUMENTS
  int calibrate( IFBP ifbp )
	
.RETURNS
	HCF_SUCCESS	
	HCF_ERR_DEFUNCT_TIMER	

.NARRATIVE
 
 Parameters:
  ifbp	address of the Interface Block
 		
  Description: calibrates the S/W protection counter against the Hermes Timer tick
	IFB_TickIni is the value used to initialize the S/W protection counter in a way which makes the
	expiration period more or less independent of the processor speed. If IFB_TickIni is not yet 
	calibrated, it is done now. This calibration is "reasonably" accurate because the Hermes is in a 
	quiet state as a result of the Initialize command. 
	
.DIAGRAM
	
 1:	IFB_TickIni is initialized at INI_TICK_INI by hcf_connect. If calibrate fails, IFB_TickIni is changed
 	to 0, If calibrate succeeds, it is garuanteed to be changed to a non-zero value different of 
 	INI_TICK_INI. As a consequence there will be exactly 1 shot at calibration per hcf_connect (see also
 	the NOTICE below)
 2:	Initiliaze the "maximum" value. Calibration is done 10 times, to diminish the effects of jitter and 
 	interence. Each of the 10 cycles is limited to at most INI_TICK_INI samples if the TimerTick status
 	of the Hermes. Since the start of calibrate is unrelated to the Hermes Internal Timer, the first 
 	interval may last from 0 to the normal interval, all subsequent intervals should be the full length of 
 	the Hermes Tick interval. The Hermes Timer Tick is not reprogrammed by the HCF, hence it is running
 	at the default of 10 k microseconds.
 3: Acknowledge the Timer Tick Event. For the first time through the loop there may or there may not be 
 	a Timer Tick Event, this does not influence the observation made under 2 above.
 4:	If a Timer Tick Event occured, update the "maximum" value accordingly. 
	If no Timer Tick Event occured before the proterction counter expired, reset IFB_TickIni to zero and
	exit the calibrate routine, thus rendering the Hermes inoperable, as explained in the NOTICE below.
	To cope with the situation that the Timer Tick Event is ALWAYS present (e.g. due to an error, we read
	0xFFFF continuously), prot_cnt is checked for zero.
 8:	Set the final protection timer represented by IFB_TickIni at the HCFCFG.H defined HCF_PROT_TIME 
 	(default 256) times the 10 k microseconds (default approximately 2.5 seconds)
.NOTICE
 o  Although there are a number of viewpoints possible, calibrate() uses now as error strategy that a single
	failure of the Hermes TimerTick is considered fatal. By resetting IFB_TickIni to zero in case of such a
	failure, neither cmd_wait nor hcfio_string will be able to exceute
 o  The Hermes does not restart nor reset its timing logic at an Initialize command. This implies that the
 	very first timing period measured after an Initialize command may be anything between 0 and whatever
 	the Hermes Timer was programmed by means of CFG_TICK_TIME. In the past the HCF programmed the Hermes
 	timer to 1 second. This definitely jeopardizes the calibration as implemented in calibrate(). 
 	By executing calibrate() only once in the lifetime of the driver would (supposedly) solve the problem.
 	This solution is not robust, due to the fragilIty of the Hermes implementation of the Initialize, Disable 
 	and Enable commands as well as due to MSF sequences of hcf_connect, hcf_disconnect.
 o	There is no hard and concrete time-out value defined for Hermes activities. The 2.5 seconds is believed
 	to be sufficiently "relaxed" for real life and to be sufficiently short to be still usefull in an 
 	environment with humans.
 o	To diminish the chance that in a pre-emptive environment IFB_TickIni is calibrated too low because the HCF
	just happens to loose control during this calibration, the calibration is performed 10 times and the
	largest value is used.
 o	In case of failure, IFB_TickIni ends up as INI_TICK_INI, which renders the HCF inoperable

														   Description: Check_comp is a support routine to check the compatibility of the HCF as actor 
														   with a specific feature supplied by the NIC
														   It is used for the following features
														   o cfg_drv_act_range_pri
														   o cfg_drv_act_range_hsi
														   o cfg_drv_act_range_sta

														   Remarks:
														   o For backward compatibilty with NICs which do not support the HSISupRange LTV, the HCF will fake an
														   HSISupRange if the Hermes indicates "not available"

														   .DIAGRAM
														   1:	0xFFFF as initial value for the unsigned variable i does garuantee that if the "else" part is not
														   executed because the Hermes does not support the LTV, the return value of check_comp is false.
														   2:	The supplier information is requested by building an LTV with the appropriate Type field (as specified
														   by parameter type) is build and passing this LTV to hcf_get_info
														   4:	Only in the case of HSISupRange, the value of i is changed from 0xFFFF to 0, garuanteeing that the return
														   value of check_comp changes from false to true. This is done to resolve lack of support of this particular
														   feature by old NICs.
														   As a negative consequence of this choice to cope with old NICs, this logic to fake acceptance of those old
														   NICs, must be removed when the Bottom Compatibilty is raised above 1.
														   The "dynamic" approach to replace the statement "if ( type == CFG_HSI_SUP_RANGE ) i = 0;" with
														   "if ( type == CFG_HSI_SUP_RANGE && cfg_drv_sup_range_hsi.variant[0].bottom == 1 ) i = 0;"
														   is not suitable because cfg_drv_sup_range_hsi does not exist when MSF_COMPONENT_ID is not defined.
														   6:	Each of the actor variants is checked against the (single) supplier bottom-top range till either an
														   acceptable match is found or all actor variants are tried 	
														   8: depending on whether a match was found or not (or i manipulated in case of a non-supported LTV),
														   true or false is returned
 	
														   If the primary firmware does not supply this RID or supplies the "old" HardwareStructure Info, the
														   Primary Compatibility check is skipped. These conditions are recognized based on the length field supplied
														   by the Hermes.

  Description: Executes synchronous Hermes Command and waits for Command Completion
  
.DIAGRAM

 1:	the test on rc checks whether a BAP initialization or a call to cmd_wait did ever fail. If so, the Hermes
	is assumed inoperable/defect, and all subsequent bap_ini/cmd_wait calls are nullified till hcf_disable
	clears the IFB_DefunctStat field.
 	
 2:	Based on the Hermes design, the read of the busy bit is superfluous because we wait for the Cmd bit in
	the Event Status register.

 3:	If Status register and command code don't match either the Hermes and Host are out of sync ( a fatal
 	error) and/or error bits are reported via the Status Register. The latter is explicitly ignored, except for:
 	- diagnose (does not use cmd_wait,	pseudo-asynchronous command which is given in-line in hcf_action 
 	  and the respons is sampled in get_info_mb)
 	- non-volatile programming command (pseudo-asynchronous command like diagnose)
 	
 	Errors reported via the Status Register should be caused by sequence violations in Hermes command 
 	sequences and hence these bugs should have been found during engineering testing. Since there is no 
 	strategy to cope with this problem, it might as well be ignored at run time.Note that for any 
 	particular situation where a strategy is formulated to handle the consequences of a particular bug 
 	causing a particular Error situation reported via the Status Register, the bug should be removed 
 	rather than adding logic to cope with the consequences of the bug.
	There have been HCF versions where an error report via the Status Register even brought the HCF in
	defunct mode (although it was not yet named like that at that time). This is particular undesirable
	behavior for a general library. A call of hcf_get_info with a non-existing RID type, already causes 
	an error report in the Status Register
	Simply reporting the error (as "interesting") is debatable. There also have been HCF versions with this
	strategy using the "vague" HCF_FAILURE code,
	An exercition to categorizing the return codes, caused this strategy to be changed to report this 
	situation with its own reurn code (HCF_ERR_CMD). Not that there have been HCFs which ignored this situation

 5:	When the Hermes reports on another command than the Host just issued, the two are apparently out of
 	sync and all bets are off about the consequences. Therefore this situation is treated the same as an
 	Hermes failure as indicated by time-out (blocking all further bap_ini/cmd_wait calls till hcf_disable.


	
.NOTICE
	Due to the general HCF strategy to wait for command completion, a 2nd command can never be excuted
	overlapping a previous command. As a consequence the Hermes requirement that no Inquiry command may be
	executed if there is still an unacknowledged Inquiry command outstanding, is automatically met.
	However, there are two pseudo-asynchronous commands (Diagnose and Download) which do not adhere to this
	general HCF strategy. In that case we rely on the MSF to do not overlap these commands, but no protection
	is offered by the HCF
	Note that this I/F violation by the MSF is catched by the HCFASSERT mechanism

.DIAGRAM


	Hcf_get_mb_info copies the contents of the oldest MailBox Info block in the MailBox
	to PC RAM. If len is less than the size of the MailBox Info block, only as much as
	fits in the PC RAM buffer is copied. After the copying the MailBox Read pointer is
	updated to point to the next MailBox Info block, hence the remainder of an "oversized"
	MailBox Info block is lost. The truncation of the MailBox Info block is NOT reflected in
	the return status. Note that hcf_get_info guarantees the length of the PC RAM buffer meets the
	minimum requirements of at least 2, so no PC RAM buffer overrun.

	Calling hcf_get_mb_info when their is no MailBox Info block available or
	when there is no MailBox at all, results in a "NULL" MailBox Info block.


 4:	Only the Diagnose-in-progress flag is cleared. In case of "UNK" it is difficult to construct the "correct"
	strategy, because this should never occur in the first place.  In case of Download, the action is
	considered terminated by the DL_STOP cmd
 	Another strategy would be to clear the cmd code if and only if the expected code
 	matches the actual code. Since in case of a mismatch something is wrong in the
 	design, no recognized criteria are present to prefer one strategy above the other.

 Parameters:

  Description: 

	;?As side effect of the Hermes Initialize command, the interrupts are disabled


.DIAGRAM
 4:	Preset the return code at Time out. Since ini_hermes is the part of the initialization of the card and 
 	since the strategy is to detect problems as a side effect of "necessary" actions to initialize the card, 
 	ini_hermes has, in deviation of the cmd_wait strategy, an "wait for busy bit drop" befor the Hermes 
 	Initilalize command is executed.
	The additional complication that no calibrated value for the protection count can be assumed since calibrate()
	may not yet have determined a calibrated value (a catch 22) is handled by the initial value set at INI_TICK_INI 
	by hcf_connect). This approach is considered safe, because:
	 o the HCF does not use the pipeline mechanism of Hermes commands.
	 o the likelihood of failure (the only time when protection count is relevant) is small.
	 o the time will be sufficiently large on a fast machine (busy bit drops on good NIC before counter expires)
	 o the time will be sufficiently small on a slow machine (counter expires on bad NIC before the enduser
	   switches the power off in despair
	The time needed to wrap a 32 bit counter around is longer than many humans want to wait, hence the more or 
	less arbitrary value of 0x40000L is chosen, assuming it does not take too long on an XT and is not too short on 
	a scream-machine.
	Note that early models of the Hermes needed some arbitrary read before the first write activity to operate
	stable (ref tracker 27). This busy drop wait achieves that function as a side effect.
	If the Hermes passes the superficial health test of waiting for the Busy bit drop, the Hermes Initialize 
	command is executed. The Initialize command acts as the "best possible" reset under HCF control. A more 
	"severe/reliable" reset is under MSF control via the COR register.
18:	Initialize the Hermes. The results of this way of initialization depends on the capabilities of the Hermes
  	firmware. Therefore, the Hermes H/W controlled bits, like those in the event status register are not guaranteed
  	to be cleared as result of the initialize command. However it is guaranteed that no more events are in the
    pipeline. Ack-ing indiscriminately all events resolves this problem. An alternative would be to use the
    resulting value of "IN_PORT_WORD( ifbp->IFB_IOBase + HREG_EV_STAT )" rather than 0xFFFF to specifically
    only reset those events which are set. This strategy is considered to be only more aesthetically pleasing
    (if that).
20:	Perform some housekeeping tasks
	Write HCF_MAGIC as signature to S/W support register 0.  This signature is used to detect card removal
	wherever the presence of the card is critical while HCF may not yet have been informed by the MSF of the
	removal of the card.

.DESCRIPTION

.ARGUMENTS
  void isr_info( IFBP ifbp )

.RETURNS
  void

.NARRATIVE

 Parameters:
  ifbp		address of the Interface Block
  		
  Description: 


 1:	First the FID number corresponding with the InfoEvent is determined and next the length of the 
 	T-field + the length of the Value-field in words are fetched into scratch buffer info.
 2: In case of tallies, the 16 bits Hermes values are accumulated in the IFB into 32 bits values. Info[0]
 	is (expected to be) HCF_NIC_TAL_CNT + 1. The contraption "while ( info[0]-- >1 )" rather than 
 	"while ( --info[0] )" is used because it is dangerous to determine the length of the Value field by 
 	decrementing info[0]. As a result of a bug in some version of the Hermes, info[0] may be 0, resulting 
 	in a very long loop in the predecrement logic.
 	In case of the Lucent AccessPoint, the tallies are put in the MailBox rather than in the IFB.
 4: In case of a link status frame, the information is copied to the IFB field IFB_linkStat as well as
 	copied to the MailBox. 
 	Although it may seem attractive to use "ifbp->IFB_LinkStat = IN_PORT_WORD( ifbp->IFB_IOBase + BAP_1 );"
 	rather than "(void)hcfio_string(ifbp, BAP_1, tmp, 0, (wci_bufp)ifbp->IFB_LinkStat, 0, 2, IO_IN );"
 	this invalidate the information in the IFB_BAP_1 structure. The subsequent put_info_mb() will then 
 	behave incorrectly
 6:	All other than Tallies (including "unknown" ones and link status which is also put in IFB_LinkStat) are 
 	put in the MailBox.  Although put_info_mb is robust against a len-parameter with value zero, it accepts 
 	any bogus value for the type-parameter.

.NARRATIVE

 Parameters:
  N.A
   		
 Description: 
	Patch_catch is intended to have an escape mechanism to help diagnose
	problems in the field with released S/W.
	Patch_catch builds on the macro INT_3.
	INT_3 in its turn is controlled by DEBUG_INT.
	When DEBUG_INT is defined, e.g. in case of the Microsoft compiler by
	specifying "/D DEBUG_INT" in the command line, INT_3 expands to an
	"int 3", otherwise into a "nop".
	Released HCF-based programs should never specify DEBUG_INT. The macro
	DEBUG_INT is intended for engineering testing during HCF-development only.
	By succeeding the INT_3 macro with the obscure "dec ax etc" sequence,
	80x86 code is generated with a bit pattern identical to the string
	"HCF-II". In the loadable file of a program which is compiled without
	DEBUG_INT, the routine patch_catch can easily be located by searching for
	the string "HCF-II". By patching the 0x90 ("nop") immediately preceeding
	this string with 0xCC (int 3"), an experienced support engineer - possibly
	with support per telephone from a WCND engineer - can get a handle to
	intercept the program execution.
	Note that the effect of the nonsense "dec ax etc" instruction sequence, is
	effectively nullified by the entry- and exit code generated by the compiler

 Parameters:
	ifbp		address of the Interface Block
	ltvp		address in NIC RAM where LVT-records are located

 Remarks:
	In case of HCF-light, it may seem that it would be an improvement to integrate this code into
	hcf_put_info, however in the full blown HCF there is more logic involved in the handling of
	configuration, which makes this integration unattractive.
	<HCFL@: Safekeeps Hermes configuration information. This information is used to restore the Hermes
	configuration after download and diagnose
	The Configuration information is a series of LTV-records, terminated with an L-field with a zero-value.
	@HCFL>

.NARRATIVE
	All the validation/adaptation logic is skipped in case of HCF-light
 2: When Encryption is enabled while the NIC (note that in this context NIC should be read as "real" H/W or 
 	P4 RID, which is something else than F/W, see also the Encryption related test on F/W level further on) 
 	does not support it, the configuration is dropped, the HCF blocks enabling and a warning bit is set 
 	for retrieval by the WaveMngrClient
	Note: do not change the HCF to do: ifbp->IFB_CardStat &= ~CARD_STAT_INCOMP_FEATURE;
		as an equivalent of what is done in the other cases cases in this function. That would cause this 
		bit to disappear if - in the future, in case of multiple potential causes - the last check is O.K. 
		regardless of the other checks.
		The CARD_STAT_INCOMP_FEATURE bit disappears only as side effect of HCF_ACT_CARD_IN
	Note also that the so-called P4 check should precede F/W compatibilty check otherwise the user is first 
	told: upgrade your F/W and after the upgrade: your H/W is incapable		
 4:	If the RID indicates enabling of Encryption, structure x is set up
 	Note that x can not be initialized at its defintion to prevent certain compilers to generate a reference
 	to the C-lib memmove function.
 	Note also that the options field must be presetted at zero, to assure that if the RID not available, 
 	encryption can't be enabled
 	Finally note that the return status is ignored because we are pursuing other things while the implementation
 	is resistent against this problem
 6:	In order to keep a resemblance to structure code, the DCWA loop counter is (mis-) used to convey the 
 	information to the "real" body of put_info that no actual configuration should take place.
 8:	The remainder of validation/adaptation logic is skipped in case of an AP because in case of an AP there 
 	is nodynamic binding between F/W and Host S/W. There is an IFB+MSFTYpe based escape to cater for AP mode 
 	on hermaphrodite AP/STA 	
10:	When Power Managemnent is enabled, the configuration is dropped and a warning bit is set for retrieval
	by the WaveMngrClient. Since there is a single bit uniquely associated with this problem it can be
	pre-cleared and set if the RID tries to set PM on a NIC with unsuitable F/W.
12:	When a RateControl above 3 is selected, the configuration is silently dropped  on a NIC with unsuitable F/W.
	Note that this "silently" is even more silent than the others because not even a bit in IFB_WarningInfo
	is set.
14: When Encryption is enabled while the NIC supports it but the F/W does not, the configuration is dropped,
	the HCF blocks enabling and a warning bit is set for retrieval by the WaveMngrClient
	Note: see the notes in the Encryption case above
20:	do not write RIDs to NICs which are incompatible with respect to Primary or Station Firmware level	<HCFL>
22: only write RIDs when the NIC is present
24: <HCFL@: If the RID does not exist, the L-field is set to zero. If the RID exists, the L-field is left at
 	one																									@HCFL>
26: write the RID to the NIC using the DataCorruptionWorkAround, up to a maximum of three times	
28:	If the RID is written successful, pass it to the NIC by means of an Access Write command

														    .NARRATIVE

														    parameters:
														    ifbp		address of the Interface Block
														    type		in case of a V record in PC RAM:
														    CFG_DIAG, CFG_WMP, CFG_UNK, CFG_DL_STAT or CFG_MB_ASSERT
														    in case of RID/FID:
														    CFG_SCAN, CFG_LINK_STAT, CFG_ASSOC_STAT
														    bufp		pointer to a V record in PC RAM or don't care in case of RID/FID
														    len			length in words of T field + V record in PC RAM

														    Description: 
														    Note that the definition of len may not be 100% intuitive at first glance, but it is historically grown
														    (in relation ship with the use of put_info_mb to copy LTVs directly from NIC RAM rather than PC RAM) and
														    changing is expected to give more problems than solve them.
	
														    If the data does not fit (including no MailBox is available), the IFB_MBTally is incremented and an 
														    HCF_ASSERT catches, but no error status is returned.
														    Calling put_info_mb when their is no MailBox available, is considered a design error in the MSF.
	

														    Note that there is always at least 1 word of unused space in the mail box.
														    As a consequence:
														    - no problem in pointer arithmetic (MB_RP == MB_WP means unambiguously mail box is completely empty
														    - There is always free space to write an L field with a value of zero after each MB_Info block.  This
														    allows for an easy scan mechanism in the "get MB_Info block" logic.

														    .DIAGRAM
														    2:	First the free space in the MailBox is calculated (2a: free part from Write Ptr to Read Ptr, 
														    2b: free part turns out to wrap around) . If this space suffices to store the number of words
														    reflected by len (T-field + Value-field) plus the additional MailBox Info L-field + a trailing 0 to act
														    as the L-field of a trailing dummy or empty LTV record, then a MailBox Info block is build in the MailBox
														    consisting of
														    -	the value len in the first word
														    -	type in the second word
														    - a copy of the contents of bufp/RID/FID in the second and higher word

														    There is a simple mapping from the publicized WCI I/F for hcf_put_info to put_info_mb
														    The WMP frame mode is recognized based on the IFB_MB_FID field of the IFB being non-zero.
		
														    In the WMP mode, the MailBox Info block is build by means of input from NIC RAM rather than copied from a
														    buffer. Since the (future) size of WMP frames is not known, it is considered to be an unattractive choice
														    to copy a WMP frame first into a temporary buffer and then use the "standard" put_info_mb to copy the
														    contents of the temporary buffer into the MailBox. Note that there are more arguments for the chosen
														    implementation, e.g. efficiency
	
														    4: Since put_info_mb() can more or less directly be called from the MSF level, the I/F must be robust
														    against out-of-range variables. As failsafe coding, the MB update is skipped by changing tlen to 0 if 
														    len == 0; This will indirectly cause an assert as result of the violation of the next if clause.
														    6:	Check whether the free space in MailBox suffizes (this covers the complete absence of the MailBox).
														    Note that len is unsigned, so even MSF I/F violation works out O.K.
														    The '2' in the expression "len+2" is used because 1 word is needed for L itself and 1 word is needed
														    for the zero-sentinel
														    8:	update MailBox Info length report to MSF with "oldest" MB Info Block size

														    5:	In case of an Hermes Information frame ( CFG_SCAN, CFG_LINK_STAT and CFG_ASSOC_STAT, as reflected by
														    "type >= CFG_INFO_FRAME_MIN"), the L and T are already copied into the MailBox, hence reading the
														    Information frame must start at offset 4.
														    In case of an Hermes Receive frame ( CFG_WMP ), reading must start at offset 0.
														    !!!	;? now we are in trouble, if this "if" clause was skipped (because the ReadPointer is larger than the
														    WritePointer), this type dependent code is not executed. Simply copying this code to the 2nd hcfio_string
														    does not work either because then it may be executed twice ;?


														    .NOTE
														    boundary testing depends on the fact that IFB_MBSize is guaranteed to be zero if no MailBox is present,
														    and to a lesser degree, that IFB_MBWp = IFB_MBRp = 0

.MODULE			put_info_tbl
.LIBRARY 		HCF
.TYPE 			function
.SYSTEM			msdos
.SYSTEM			unix
.SYSTEM			NW4
.APPLICATION	Card Initialization Group for WaveLAN based drivers and utilities
.DESCRIPTION	stores Hermes configuration information in the CfgTbl of the IFB

.ARGUMENTS
  void put_info_tbl( IFBP ifbp, LTVP ltvp )

.RETURNS
	void

.NARRATIVE

 Parameters:
  	ifbp		address of the Interface Block
  	ltvp		address of LTV in PC RAM to be stored in CfgTbl

.NARRATIVE
 Safekeeps Hermes configuration information. This information is used to restore the Hermes configuration 
 after download and diagnose.
 The Configuration information is a series of LTV-records, terminated with an L-field with a zero-value.
 This zero terminator is used to guard the scanning through the table.

.DIAGRAM
 2:	scan for the end of the configuration information within the table or till the same configuration
	as specified by the parameter ltvp is found
 4:	if the action code is already present in CfgTbl, move the remaining LTV-records of the CfgTbl forward, 
	thus overwriting the old record corresponfing with parameter ltvp.
 6:	move one LTV at a time. Note that i, reflecting the total size of the LTV, is one more than the value
	of L (which reflects the size of T+V )
 8: test for sufficient space in CfgTbl. If too little space, this is silently ignored, no action (except
	an Assert) 
10:	copy type, len and RID contents to CfgTbl
12:	For safety reason, make sure there is a zero-terminator. This  allows the MSF to shrink the multicast 
	table etc.
