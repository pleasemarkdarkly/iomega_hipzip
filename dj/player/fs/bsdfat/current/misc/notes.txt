notes on the interface between the eCos filesystem layer and the
msdosfs (fat) layer from FreeBSD (approx jan 1 2002 snap)

* moved all file operation functions to msdosfs_fo_* in msdosfs_fops.c
* not going to seperate out directory operation functions, since
  msdosfs_fo_read handles both readdir() and standard read() style
  requests
* removed references to vnodes


object mapping

cyg_file
 * f_mte   points to cyg_mtab_entry
 * f_data  points to denode


cyg_mtab_entry
 * data    points to msdosfsmount (internal mount data)
 * root    points to denode

msdosfmount
 * pm_mountp  points to cyg_mtab_entry

denode
 * de_pmp     points to msdosfsmount
 * de_dev     is an io handle (cyg_file mapped to an io handle?)
 * de_vnode   is a cyg_file

cyg_dir is actually a denode ptr; eCos defines cyg_dir as a
CYG_ADDRWORD and just passes it around. we'll use it to point to a denode
