# all numbers are hexidecimal, without a leading 0x
# order is important, there is no parse tree, etc.
# collision detection is pretty minimal, images must be arranged in the
# order they need to appear, so a forced image must be at about the right place
# (usually ok, the only forced images should be codecs, and bootloader, which
# are at the beginning and end of usable space.
