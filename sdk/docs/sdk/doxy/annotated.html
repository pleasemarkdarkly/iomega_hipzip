The content record has an ID unique across the content manager, a URL unique across the system, and the ID of the data source it's stored on. Content records are also considered verified if they've been found to reside on a data source (as opposed to solely existing in the database from a previous run). They also have a status which specifies their ability to be run through a codec for playback)
<li><a class="el" href="classIDataSource.html">IDataSource</a>  (The data source is an abstract representation of a provider of content. It has methods for obtaining a list of content on the data source, fetching metadata for that content, and creating input streams for a given piece of content)
<li><a class="el" href="structIFilter.html">IFilter</a>  (Dadio(tm) uses an asbtract interface for filters, which allow components to examine and modify the current PCM audio stream.
