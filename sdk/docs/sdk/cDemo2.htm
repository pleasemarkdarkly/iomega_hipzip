<p class="Body1">
The hard drive #2 demo builds on demo #1. This demo reads tracks from the CD-ROM player and Compact Flash, as well as the hard drive. Several of the player controls are changed to support selecting a group of tracks based on artist, album, or genre of the content.  This demo highlights the ability of the player to manage large amounts of content. It demonstrates saving and loading the state of the content manager to keep content update times to a minimum. The infrastructure that supports this functionality is a Metakit embedded database. 
</p>
<p class="Body1">
This demo does not start playing immediately; you must first populate the content manager by starting a content refresh, or by loading state.
To get the most from this demo, you need to copy several CDs of diverse music to the hard drive.

	Same as Demo #1.
</td></tr>
	<tr valign="top"><td>4	</td><td>Generate List By Artist</td><td>

<br>

Pushing the button again cycles through the list of artists in alphabetical order.

	</td></tr>
	<tr valign="top"><td>5	</td><td>Generate List By Album</td><td>	
Pressing the Sort by Album button causes the demo to generate a list of all tracks on a single album on all available media. The demo then plays the first track in the list.<br>
<br>

</td></tr>	

<tr valign="top"><td>7	</td><td>Save Playlist	</td><td>
	The save Playlist button saves the current playlist to a Playlist file on the hard drive. The UI displays "Saved Playlist" on the status line if the operation is successful.
<br>
<br>
The demo saves the playlist on the hard drive in the Dharma proprietary *.dpl format.

</td></tr>
	<tr valign="top"><td>8	</td><td>Save Device State	</td><td>
	Same as Demo #1, but it also saves the state of the content manager (the database containing the track information).

</td></tr>



	<tr valign="top"><td>9	</td><td>Stop	</td><td>Same as Demo #1.</td></tr>
	<tr valign="top"><td>10	</td><td>Next track	</td><td>

Pushing the button again cycles through the list of genres in alphabetical order.


</td></tr>
	<tr valign="top"><td>13	</td><td>Generate List by Playlist</td><td>
	This button cycles through all playlists (*.m3u and *.dpl files) found on all available media during content refresh. When you press this button, a single playlist is loaded and the first track starts playing.
	</td></tr>
	<tr valign="top"><td>14	</td><td>Query drive-refresh content DB</td><td>	Pressing this button causes the unit to spider all available drives and create a content database of all tracks found on all media types active.  <br>
<br>

For each data source, the message line displays the messages, "Starting content update on data source X", "Scanning content on data source X", "Content update finished on data source X", "Scanning metadata on data source X", and finally, "Metadata update finished on data source X", where X is the ID of the data source.<br>
<br>

The Dharma board then starts playing the first track in the database.  
</td></tr>
	<tr valign="top"><td>15	</td><td>Load Playlist</td><td>
	
	The Load Playlist button loads the Playlist saved using button #7. If no playlist has been saved with button #7, this button does nothing.
