The Dharma SDK comes with a test application that demonstrates USB
bulk storage functionality. This test program works for the hard drive
and for compact flash cards, but must be compiled specifically for
each target. The bulk storage driver has been configured for single
Logical Unit Number (LUN) only. The purpose of this test app is to allow developers to
transfer content via USB from the host to the device. The driver has
not been fully tested against all hosts, and may not be suitable for
shipping products.
</p>

<p class="Body1">

Althought USB bulk storage is a standardized protocol, not all
operating systems come with driver support for it. Internally we have
only used Windows 2000 Professional with this driver, although it
should work with Windows ME and XP.

<p class="Body1">
The RedBoot stub image should contain two versions of the USB test
app: one for transfering files to a compact flash card, and one for
transfering files to the hard drive. The hard drive based image
assumes the hard drive is jumpered as a slave. Before loading the
application, make sure the usb module is present on the board, and the
USB cable is unplugged from the device.

</p>
<p class="Body1">
To load the pre-built USB test app, refer to the section titled
<a href="oBurnToFlash.htm#oBurnToFlash">Transfering the image to the device</a>. At the
RedBoot> prompt, enter the following command:

</p>
<p class="CodeBlock">RedBoot> fis list</p>

<p class="Body1">
This should print a list of available images in the flash. To load the
hard drive test app, enter the following command:

</p>
<p class="CodeBlock">RedBoot> fis load usb_hd
</p>
<p class="Body1">
Or, for the compact flash test app, use the following:
</p>

<p class="CodeBlock">RedBoot> fis load usb_cf</p>

<p class="Body1">
To start executing the device side of the code, use the "go" command:
</p>

<p class="CodeBlock">RedBoot> go</p>

<p class="Body1">
At this point the device will be ready to initialize itself on the USB
bus. Make sure the host end of your usb cable is plugged into your
computer, and connect the device end into the Dharma board. The
host should enumerate the hard drive, which may take some time
depending on the drive capacity. The device should show up as a
"Removable Disk" under "My Computer" on Windows machines.

</p>
<p class="Body1">
When you are done transferring files to the device, be sure to stop the
device and unplug it prior to resetting the board.

<tr valign='top'><td><h3><a name=''>Building your own USB test app</a></h3></td>
				<td>
<p class="Body1">
To build your own USB test app, you must configure a product build
tree to link against the USB enabled kernel. You can modify an
existing product configuration, or generate a new one specifically for
USB enabled software. This step simply requires modifying the
ECOS_BUILD_NAME value in the file <span class="Code">configs/&lt;target>.mk</span> to read

</p>
<p class="CodeBlock">ECOS_BUILD_NAME := usb-ram</p>

<p class="Body1">
and rebuilding your image against the new kernel according to the
documentation in the section <a href="oCreateImage.htm#oCreateImage">Building the image</a>. Multiple
variations of the ATA driver have been packaged, allowing USB to
access various physical layouts. In the event that an ATA
configuration supporting both the hard drive and compact flash
interfaces is used, the USB test will default to the hard drive
interface.

</p>
<p class="Body1">
Once you have recreated the build tree against the USB enabled kernel,
rebuild the USB test app by going to the build directory:

</p>
<p class="CodeBlock">cd builds/simple</p>

<p class="Body1">
And issuing the following "make" command:
</p>

<p class="CodeBlock">make ata_storage_tests</p>

<p class="Body1">
This will build all the available ATA tests, one of which is the usb
test. The tests will be put in the ATA module directory under the
build directory, <span class="Code">devs/storage/ata/&lt;version>/tests/*</span>. The generated
image can be loaded via gdb, or transfered through RedBoot and
burned to the device.
