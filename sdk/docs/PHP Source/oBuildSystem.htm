This section describes how to configure and build a target image to download to the Dharma board.
</p>




<p class="Body1">
Dharma is designed to be flexible and to maximize reuse of code. To
that end, we have designed a custom build and configuration system
suited to our needs. This involves organizing the source code into
modules and writing custom configuration scripts for each module, in
addition to parsing configuration scripts and generating appropriate
build trees. Our build system uses perl, GNU make, and GNU toolchain to create an image using a
combination of pre-existing and generated makefiles.

</p>
<?= head("","Build a Target Image",0); ?>
<p class="Body1">
To create an already-configured image, all you need to do is:
</p>

	<p class="CodeBlock">cd /c/iobjects/dadio/<br>
	make <em>&lt;target></em></p>
<p class="Body1">
... where <em>&lt;target></em> is the name of an existing configuration. The SDK comes with three pre-built configurations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>simple</li>
	<li>hdcdcf</li>
	<li>net</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body1">
These correspond to <?= crossref("cDemo1", "Demo #1"); ?>, <?= crossref("cDemo2", "Demo #2"); ?>, and <?= crossref("cDemo3", "Demo #3"); ?> described elsewhere in the documentation.
</p>

<p class="Body1">
Invoking <span class="Code">make simple</span> from the "dadio" directory generates the build tree, creates a list of modules, generates make files for each module, and links in a build Makefile. It then switches to the build directory and automatically starts compiling the build. If successful, you should have a finished image ready for downloading in the "builds/simple" directory.
</p>
<p class="Body1">
 To download the image to the Dharma board, see <?= crossref("oDownloadImage", "Download an Image"); ?>.

</p>

<p class="Body1">
Once you have run the top-level Makefile, you have a build tree for the configuration. To rebuild the configuration, you can <span class="Code">cd</span> into the build directory and type <span class="Code">make</span>. If you have updated any of the configuration files, the whole tree will be regenerated. You can clean out existing object dependencies using <span class="Code">make clean</span> or <span class="Code">make depclean</span>.

</p>
<?= head("","Create a New Target Configuration",0); ?>
<p class="Body1">
When you're creating a new configuration, these are the basic steps:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Edit the DCL file in the source directory for each module.</li>
	<li>In the "config/" tree, create a <span class="Code"><em>&lt;target></em>_modules</span> file listing all of the modules used in your configuration.</li>
	<li>In the "config/" tree, create a <span class="Code"><em>&lt;target></em>.mk</span> file specifying the name of the target, the eCos Build name, and any environment variables or macros to execute during the build process.</li>
	<li>Add the target name to the <span class="Code">config/targets</span> file.</li>
	<li>Perform the build steps as described above.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Body1">
These steps are described in greater detail in following sections.
</p>



<?= head("oSDKFiles","SDK Product Directory Files",2); ?>
<p class="Body1">
The base for all files in the sdk is the 'dadio' directory. For
this section, references to full paths assume you
installed the SDK in "C:\iobjects\dadio", which has a corresponding cygwin path
of "/c/iobjects/dadio".

</p>


<p class="Body1">
In the 'dadio' directory you will find the following items:

</p>
<dl>
<dt>Makefile</dt>
 <dd> The top level product Makefile. This allows you to create and remove
  build trees for a specified target.</dd>

<?php /*
 #### Not sure if this will be included
<dt>Makefile.ecos</dt>
 <dd> Used internally to configure and build eCos, the kernel we use for
  booting and threading our device.</dd>
#### end */ 
?>

<dt>configs/</dt>
<dd>  A directory with files for each target, and a makefile include
  (targets.mk) which specifies the available targets.</dd>

<dt>images/</dt> 
<dd>  Pre-built utility and demo images that you can burn onto Dharma and
  experiment with, including documentation describing how to use them.
</dd>
<dt>docs/ </dt>
<dd>  Documentation for the SDK.</dd>

<dt>ecos/ </dt>
<dd>  A directory with builds of various kernel configurations.</dd>

<dt>player/ </dt>
<dd>  All the code and libraries shipped with the SDK.</dd>

<dt>scripts/ </dt>
<dd>  Support utilities and scripts used by the build and configuration
  system. You shouldn't need to modify the contents of this
  directory.
</dd>
<dt>support/ </dt>
<dd>  Various images and utilities for downloading images to and
  configuring the board.
</dd>
</dl>



<p class="Body1">
As a general rule, all filenames that start with an underscore ('_')
are generated automatically. Generated files live only in the build tree.
