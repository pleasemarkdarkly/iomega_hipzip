<p class="Body1">
The <span class="Module">Content Manager</span> tracks all of the media content records from all of the data sources, and manages playlists. Of all of the SDK objects, the <span class="Module">Content Manager</span> and its children are the objects you may want to customize.
</p>

<p class="Body1">All <span class="Module">Content Manager</span> objects must extend the <span class="Code">IContentManager</span> class. The <span class="Module">Play Manager</span> calls several of these methods to determine what track to play next, and handle numerous other events. </p>

<?= picture("IContentManagerClass.gif", "IContentManager Class Diagram"); ?>


<p class="Body1">
<span class="Module">Content Manager</span> objects track all active content objects. Content objects include both playlist files and individual tracks. 
</p>
<p class="Body1">
The <span class="Module">Content Manager</span> manages a set of media content records. The <span class="Module">Play Manager</span> notifies the <span class="Module">Content Manager</span> when new media is available, when new Metadata has been retrieved, if a track was unplayable, or several other conditions. Your client application handles creating the <span class="Module">Content Manager</span> and passing the pointer to the <span class="Module">Play Manager</span>, as well as storing the serialized state.
</p>
<?= head("aQueryableContentManager","Queryable Content Manager",3); ?>

<p class="Body1">
The <span class="Code">CSimpleContentManager</span> class is a simple implementation of <span class="Code">IContentManager</span>. If you want to scan the list of content records using any metadata (by Artist, for example), you will probably want to use a class that derives from <span class="Code">IQueryableContentManager</span>. The <span class="Code">CMetakitContentManager</span> extends this class, allowing you to query it for lists of Artists, Albums, Genres, or everything.
</p>

<p class="Body1">
The Queryable Content Manager class provides ways of filtering tracks based on metadata. Other than the demo applications, the SDK does not require you to use this class.
</p>

<?= head("aContentRecord","Content Records",3); ?>
<p class="Body1">
A generic content record represents an individual file on a data source.  <span class="Code">IContentRecord</span> is an abstract class that is extended by both <span class="Code">IMediaContentRecord</span> and <span class="Code">IPlaylistContentRecord</span>. 
</p>

<p class="Body1">
The <span class="Code">IPlaylistContentRecord</span> abstract class is primarily provided as a standard interface to save and load playlists to media. See <?= crossref("aPlaylistFormatManager", "Playlist Format Manager"); ?> for more about saving Playlists. A Playlist Content Record simply contains a URL corresponding to a data source and file location of a playlist file. 
</p>

<p class="Body1">A Media Content Record, in addition to containing a URL pointing to the file on the data source (the implementation of IContentRecord), contains properties representing metadata of the track.</p>
