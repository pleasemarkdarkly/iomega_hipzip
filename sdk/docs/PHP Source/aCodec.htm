<p class="Body1">
The Dharma OS provide an abstract interface to codecs (typically
decoders). Arbitrary codecs can be linked in with the library and
be automatically available to applications. Codecs are associated with
a range of file extensions, and can optionally be probed to determine
if they can decode a given bitstream. Codecs are dynamically created
and released.
</p>
<?= head("","Components",3); ?>

<p class="Body1">
There are 3 basic pieces to the Dharma(tm) codec system, each of which
are covered in more detail later:
</p>

<ol>
<li><?= crossref("cICodec", "ICodec interface"); ?><br>

   (<span class="Code">./player/codec/common/include/Codec.h</span>)<br>
   
        The ICodec interfaces describes the necessary APIs that a codec
   must implement to operate in the Dharma environment.</li>

<li><?= crossref("aCodecManager", "CCodecManager class"); ?><br>

   (<span class="Code">./player/codec/codecmanager/include/CodecManager.h</span>)<br>

        The CCodecManager class provides a mechanism for locating a
   given codec by file extensions it supports (such as ".mp3"), by a
   specific codec ID in situations where the type of codec is well
   known (as is the case with CD audio), and also by probing available
   codecs to determine if they can decode the bitstream.</li>

<li><?= crossref("cCodecRegistration", "Registration interface"); ?><br>

   (<span class="Code">./player/codec/common/include/Codec.h</span>)<br>
   
        The registration interface provides a way for arbitrary
   objects to make themselves globally visible to Dharma(tm). The Codec
   interface defines the necessary macros to register your class and
   define certain basic routines needed for the CCodecManager class to
   properly work with your codec.</li>
</ol>
<?= head("","Program flow",3); ?>

<p class="Body1">
During startup, all codecs register themselves with the system
(specifically, with the system registry). Later on, during player
initialization, the CCodecManager singleton is instantiated, and it
builds a list of supported file extensions based on the registered
codec list. At this point the CCodecManager is available to fulfill
the system's codec needs.

</p>

<p class="Body1">
The goal of the codec system is to allow third party codec writers to
easily integrate their codec into the Dharma(tm) OS. This is
accomplished by providing a single interface (ICodec) to write to, and
a registration system to incorporate their codec into the main
system. 

</p>


<?= head("aCodecManager","Codec Manager",3); ?>
<p class="Body1">
The <span class="Module">Codec Manager</span> is a singleton object that the system can use to
access available codecs. It keeps a list of supported extensions, in
addition to table of pointers to creation routines for the available
codecs. The assembly of this list is facilitated through the
registration interface.

</p>
<p class="Body1"> When the <span class="Module">Media Player</span> gets an input stream, it passes the codec ID stored in the media content record to the <span class="Module">Codec Manager</span> to get a codec.</p>
<p class="Body1">If the codec cannot decode the input stream, or the codec ID is missing or invalid, the <span class="Module">Codec Manager</span> first attempts to load a codec associated with the file extension. If that doesn't work, the <span class="Module">Codec Manager</span> will step through all of the registered codecs to find one that works. If none work, the <span class="Module">Media Player</span> returns an error.</p>
