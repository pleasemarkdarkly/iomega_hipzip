<p class="Body1">The <span class="Module">ICodec</span> class is a wrapper class for your actual codecs. The SDK includes full codecs for the WMA and PCM formats, and pre-compiled object code for the ARM MP3 codec.</p>
<p class="Note"><strong>Note:</strong> The included MP3 codec is licensed from ARM, Inc. <!-- Interactive Objects is permitted to distribute object code for this codec only. If you need source code, contact Advanced RISC Machines directly. --></p>
<p class="Body1">You can add a new codec by simply writing a new wrapper object that extends the <span class="Module">ICodec</span> class, calling the appropriate methods on the codec from the wrapper.</p>

See the <?= crossref("/Codec_8h-source", "Codec.h"); ?> file for the specific structures and methods for the <span class="Module">ICodec</span> class.

<p class="Body1">
Dharma provides an abstract way for codecs to be available to the
playback system through codec registration. The actual registration
process has been simplified to a pair of easy to use macros, which
take care of the actual work.

<p class="Body1">
        Fills out the codec class definition with additional members
        necessary for codecs to work in Dharma. This
        satisfies the underlying requirements of the ident
        (IIdentifiableObject) baseclass.
