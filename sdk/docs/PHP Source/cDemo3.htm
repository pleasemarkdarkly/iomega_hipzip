The streaming technologies demo uses Shoutcast URLs to connect to a streaming data source. This demo uses the same player controls as the <?= crossref("Demo1", "hard drive #1 demo"); ?>, except for loading and saving device state (buttons #8 and #16).  The data source consists of several URLs hard-coded into the <span class="Code">main.cpp</span> file that the device accesses on startup and streams through the player.  A Next Shoutcast URL button (mapped to button #7) lets you cycle through all of the URLs mapped to the demo.
