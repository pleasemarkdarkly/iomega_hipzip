<p class="Body1">
The Dharma<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> SDK (also referred to as Dharma<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> Application Stack or
simply Dharma<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP>) provides a diverse and well defined set of APIs and
components necessary for commercial digital audio playback. This
release of the Dharma OS, as an external SDK for external parties
to develop with, is the first source release of Dharma in any form,
and, naturally, is our best. Dharma is a "living" system, in that
we are constantly adding new features and functionality into the core
system, so this SDK is a snapshot of Dharma that has been polished
for release.

<?= head("","Documentation structure",2); ?>

<p class="Body1">
The full documentation is available both online and in PDF format. The documentation is divided into the following areas:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><?= crossref("arOverview", "Architectural Overview"); ?> &ndash; A description of the Dharma Operating System.</li>
	<li><?= crossref("cCreateMediaPlayer", "Player Tutorial"); ?> &ndash; How to use the Dharma SDK to develop a media player.</li>
	<li><?= crossref("oInstallationGuide", "Dharma Board documentation"); ?> &ndash; Instructions for using the Dharma board, including downloading and image creation, hardware specifications, and data sheets.</li>
	<li><?= crossref("doxy/index.html", "API Reference"); ?> &ndash; Reference for each class in the Dharma SDK.</li>
</ul>


<?= head("","Documentation conventions",2); ?>

<ul>
<li>Filenames are written in UNIX form and are relative to the "sdk"
  folder. So if the documentation refers to a file
  <span class="Code">./player/util/registry/include/Registry.h</span>
  and you installed in c:\dadio, the full unix path would be:
  <span class="Code">/dadio/sdk/player/util/registry/include/Registry.h</span>
  and the DOS path might be:
  <span class="Code">c:\dadio\sdk\player\util\registry\include\Registry.h</span>.</li>

<li>Resources are defined as modules that a given component relies on.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
	<dt>Cygwin</dt>
	<dd>A UNIX environment for Windows. The free Cygwin package is on the Dharma SDK CD-ROM, and includes the <span class="Code">bash</span> shell and several UNIX tools.</dd>
	
	<dt>Dadio<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP></dt>
	<dd>Obsolete. The former name of the software application stack included with Dharma. </dd>
	
	<dt>DCL</dt>
	<dd>Dharma Configuration Language. A custom mini-language for generating different options in makefiles used to build Dharma-based images.</dd>
	
	<dt>Dharma<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP></dt>
	<dd>A hardware board used for developing Dharma objects, and the software application stack provided in this SDK for jump-starting your development. The hardware consists of a motherboard, CPU, and many peripherals that may be plugged in or removed to test various configurations. The software consists of a set of embedded objects written in C++ that are designed for the Cirrus 7312, 7409, and 9312 chips.</dd>

	<dt><a name="aeCos">eCos</a><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP></dt>
	<dd>"Embedded Configurable Operating System." An open-source real-time operating system used by Dharma. Dharma does not include the source for eCos &ndash; instead, it provides object code for three different configurations: minimum RAM configuration, network-enabled, and USB-enabled. If these configurations do not meet your needs, contact Interactive Objects. </dd>
	
	<dt>PCM</dt>
	<dd>Pulse Code Modulation. A digital scheme for transmitting analog data.</dd>

	<dt>Symbolic Links</dt>
	<dd>Similar to Windows shortcuts, symbolic links are a way of having one file or directory appear in multiple places in the file system. A symbolic link is sort of a soft link that points to a file actually located somewhere else. The convenience of this is that you can have a single copy of a file, but use it from several locations (when compiling, for example).</dd>
