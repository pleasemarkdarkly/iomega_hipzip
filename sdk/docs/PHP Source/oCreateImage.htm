<ol>
<li> Start a bash shell and <span class="Code">cd</span> into your installation directory:
<p class="CodeBlock">cd /c/iobjects/dadio/sdk</p>
 </li>
<li>Determine which target you want to build by looking at the available targets in <span class="Code">configs/targets.mk</span>, then build it. This generates the build tree, and creates a player image:
<p class="CodeBlock">make simple</p>
</li>
 
<li>After the build is completed, you can <span class="Code">cd</span> into the build directory to find the generated image:
<p class="CodeBlock">cd builds/simple<br>
ls -l simple.exe
</p></li>

</ol> 
<p class="Note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Since the build tree was created in step #2, you can build directly from the build directory and save a little time from this point on:<br>
<br>

<span class="Code">cd /c/iobjects/dadio/sdk/builds/simple<br>

make
</span>
